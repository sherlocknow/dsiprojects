CRedit,"Whether you are just starting out repairing your credit, building from no credit, or maintaining credit you should include as many details as possible when asking for help or feedback. Good credit has a general formula, but it is but no means an exact science. There are many details that shouldn't be overlooked to get the best possible suggestions/feedback.

**Try to include as many of the following details as possible:**

- All accounts, cards, loans, mortgages, etc - the bad *and* the good. (Include their name as this is helpful for knowing previous strategies to deal with them.)

- Credit Limits

- Balances (Round this number - it will keep you anonymous)

- Last payment date

- Date of last delinquency (this will determine when it falls off your report)

- Date opened

- Payment status (pays as agreed, sold to collections, etc)

- Estimation of # of lates (30, 60, 90, 120+)

**Do not include any of the following:**

- Any and all personal information. You may freely share generic information (ie you have a name on your report that is not yours)

- Addresses

- Names

- Social Security Number"
CRedit,"Here is the text from their site:

""During these times of COVID-19, accessing your credit is important. That's why Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are now offering free weekly online reports through April 2021.""


It is definitely worth getting your reports at least once a month during this period.  If you are paying for various services, you may want to suspend that to save some money.  Unfortunately this does NOT INCLUDE the key credit scores.  Those are still for pay only at the usual sites.


There are several pieces of KEY INFORMATION on your official reports that are not readily available on most the typical free credit reporting sites.  Notable your DOFD (date of first delinquency) and the calculated date when a negative item should be removed from your report."
CRedit,"I’m not sure if this has been discussed before, but I recently posted on here and got some amazing and kind feedback. This subreddit made me feel like my credit debt wasn’t the end of the world and something I could tackle.

Unfortunately, along with all of the good came multiple attempts at scamming me. I had two people reach out to me offering to help pay off my debt and asking for my login/ password for my credit cards. They will feign niceness and sincerity, while trying to gather information from you. It seems like it can’t be that bad, because they are offering to help, but after some research I’ve learned that these types of scams will start with them paying off debt and then following up by asking you to buy things on your credit card to help them. They will pay off your debt with stolen cards and it will appear as though you’re at a 0 balance, but once fraud is discovered, the amount that was paid off will be replaced, including anything extra you paid for the person.  

I apologize if this has already been discussed, but I had not seen it and being naive I almost fell for it. Thankfully I grew up using google and researching things when I am not sure, so if there’s someone out there that doesn’t do the research, maybe they will read this and be a little more careful. 

Side note: I also have been contacted about working for people as well. They want you to send all your information to them, which also seems to be a scam. Be careful out there people, and if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."
CRedit,"Hi all. Long story short I lost my job last year and had my four accounts charged off. My credit score plummeted to a 499. So after following the advice on here and elsewhere. I got an open sky credit card (pretty much the only card I could get - its bad when you can't even get secured cards).

I used the card only for my subscription services (Spotify, Netflix, etc) and when the bill came, I paid it off. I get an email today from WalletHub that my score shot up and when I looked I was at 602. Still sucky but that's an impressive jump. I am working on settling my charge offs but due to covid I am trying to be responsible as possible to have money on hand to pay expenses.

 Any advice on what to do next?"
CRedit,"Long time lurker, read everything I could find that's similar to my situation and don't know what to do next. Really appreciate any advice you might have for my specific situation!

**ME:** 29-year-old, bad credit, fluctuating income (freelancer), no credit card debt, no student loan debt, no car payment, no rent or mortgage

**BACKGROUND:** ruined my credit after college by being dumb and irresponsible. Credit went down to 380 in 2017 and has since slowly recovered to 600s as the derogatory marks age

**CREDIT SCORE:** 597 Experian, 627 Equifax and 630 TransUnion as of today

**DEROGATORY CLOSED ACCOUNTS:** 

1. Bank of America Credit Card #1: account charged off for $75 - date of first delinquency 03/01/2017 - **PAID IN FULL**
2. Bank of America Credit Card #2: account closed at credit grantor's request - $1,929.00 was over 120 days past due - last activity date 11/01/2018 - **PAID IN FULL**
3. Chase Credit Card: account closed at credit grantor's request - $4,919.00 was over 120 days past due - date of first delinquency 07/01/2017 - **PAID IN FULL**

**NEUTRAL CLOSED ACCOUNTS:**

1. Macy's Store Credit Card: paid and closed at consumer's request in 2015 - no late payment
2. TJMaxx Store Credit Card: paid and closed at consumer's request in 2015 - no late payment
3. Chevron Credit Card: paid and closed at consumer's request in 2015 - no late payment

**OPEN ACCOUNT:**

1. Chase Credit Card: credit limit $3,000.00 - pay full amount each moth - 9 years &amp; 6 months

**HARD INQUIRIES:** Capital One Bank on 08/31/2020 (I just applied for their secured credit card)

**STEPS TAKEN:**

1. Paid off amount owed to closed credit cards
2. 100% on-time payment for 2 years
3. 30-40% credit utilization rate for 2 years
4. Added to my spouse's (825 credit score) credit card as an authorized user
5. Just got approved for a Discover secured credit card for $2,000. Will make sure this account's payment history is immaculate 
6. Just started a 12-month Self credit building loan. Will make sure this loan's payment history is immaculate

**QUESTION:**

1. I have no loan (own my car, parents paid for college, parents own the apartment I live in and don't charge me rent) and honestly am hesitant to apply for a one just for the sake of having it. However, I only have one open account on my credit report and can definitely benefit from more positive payments, hence signing up for Self. Is there any other non-auto, non-housing loans I should look into? 
2. I have not disputed the three derogatory accounts on my credit report because they are all accurate... However, I read people trying regardless and bet on auto-deletion if they don't respond in 30 days. Is that even true? So many people suggest PFD method, which did not work in my case at all. Granted, my debt was never sold to a third party. 

I really appreciate any insight you can offer. I regret everyday for not being responsible with personal finance and for ignoring my bad habits for way too long. I am however determined to continue working toward repairing my credit score slowly and steadily. My goal is to reach 720, which is the score I had back in 2015. 

Thank you for reading!"
CRedit,"I need some serious help getting my finances in order. My car broke down last week and can't be repaired. I'm choosing to look at this as a blessing in disguise because it's forced me to finally face the mountain of debt that I've been building and ignoring for over a year now. I'm 23 years old and I've recklessly racked up $13,000 in credit card debt.


My current credit score is 588 (Vantage score from Credit Karma). My mother recently purchased a new vehicle and agreed to let me borrow her old car for one year with no car payments (I realize how lucky I am and I am extremely thankful). This means I have 12 months to figure out how I'm going to finance a car.


**Here's the budget I'm working with...**

Monthly income (after taxes): $2,400

*Expenses:* 

Rent &amp; utilities: $1000

Car &amp; renters insurance: $179

Phone bill: $50

Gas: $60

Groceries/toiletries: $300

Entertainment/miscellaneous: $150

Pet care: $75 (varies but I'd like to set this aside each month)

---

This budget leaves me with $586/mo leftover. Seemed like plenty until I realized how much debt I'm in... 

American Express card: **$8,216 at 22.99%** *(limit = $8400)* Minimum payment: $167 

Discover card: **$4,562 at 17.99%** *(limit = $4,500)* Minimum payment: $92 

Comenity Capital Bank/ULTA card: **$62 at ?%** *(limit = $1,250)*


My credit score is 588. I'd like to bring it up to 650 as soon as possible and ideally higher than that 12 months from now. I have zero late or missed payments and zero derogatory marks. Only 1 hard inquiry in the past two years which is about to fall off. My total credit card utilization is at 92% right now, which is killing my score. I also only have 3 total accounts and they are all credit cards.


**A few other important factors** 
 
 1. I have zero savings left. Currently living paycheck to paycheck. 
 
 2. I usually get a monthly bonus in addition to my salary. This ranges typically from $400 - $600 but isn't a guarantee and there have been months where I didn't bonus, so I'm not including it as fixed income and I want to make a budget that works without this. 
 
 3. I own a broken down car that needs a new engine. It's worth around $2,000 as-is. 
 
 4. I have furniture in storage that I need to sell worth around $1000. 
 
 5. I have to cover any medical expenses out of pocket and get reimbursed out of an HSA account. This can take a few weeks to receive so I need to be able to float the money for any health care expenses. Right now this is really difficult because I have no savings and no available credit left to spend. 
 
 6. I have cancelled all monthly subscriptions (streaming services, gym membership, etc).


My plan this month is to pay off the entire Ulta credit card balance and to pay at least the minimum on my Amex and Discover cards.


This would leave me with about $250 leftover (once the Ulta card is paid it'll be over $300/mo). Realistically I'll be able to save more than this because I plan on being extremely frugal for the next few weeks and I over-budgeted for groceries and entertainment. I'm also anticipating on getting a bonus of around $400 this month.


My question is -- what's the smartest thing to do with any extra money I have each month?


Please help me come up with a plan here! Am I better off saving up as much as I can to build up a nest egg and then pay cash for a car in 12 months? Or am I better off working all year to bring up my credit score so that I can get a car loan? And is that even a realistic possibility given my situation? I'd like to consolidate my credit card debt and lower the APR, but with my current credit score my options are pretty limited. I stupidly racked up all this credit card debt while I was in school and now I'm paying for it. Please tell me there's hope for me to get out of this!"
CRedit,"Hi guys!I'm a 28F in Canada who recently moved back in with my parents due to COVID (since April). I have a fair credit score of 708 (Vantage score, TransUnion) that has been slowly building up by 1 or 2 points per month despite the fact that I always make minimum payments on my CC's and pay off my 2 cards in full every month. I have a student loan that is currently not in payment and 4 inquiries from last year. I don't spend a lot of money ($200-300 a month) but I make sure to charge it on my CC to build credit. Just saw that my scored dropped 15 points this month and I got a credit report but there's been no changes to my financial behaviour. How do I increase my score more drastically? And how can I figure out why my score dropped so much?

Thank you in advance for any help! I'm good with not spending money but still learning to be financially literate!"
CRedit,"In another group on social media it was suggested that a person should go through their credit reports and remove anything outdated like old addresses and employers. My question is how is that done? I’ve gone to the dispute pages for the major bureaus and on TransUnion site it simply allows you to remove it no questions asked in their disputes but on Experian and Equifax sites they require reasons for deletion. My only concern is that the information is entirely accurate but their site reason options are only if factually incorrect, so can I get the info removed if it is correct info and if so, how?

Thanks for the help in advance."
CRedit,"Hello,


What is with the scammers nowadays? 
How do they find their target? And on which bases they choose them? 

The last few weeks I have been receiving many phone calls and messages.

The phone calls they say they are from my benefits department and they wanna talk about having my rx delivered to me. 

The messages are coming from my credit banks. Like yesterday I received a message from chase saying they caught a potential fraudulent charge and asked to verify if it was me or not and reply.the message had chase symbole and looked legit.  I didn't reply. 

But today I saw the same message in my email. It is a very private email that I only use for banks and similar accounts. I don't use it for anything else and I don't open it that often.

So seeing this email makes me worried. Are my emails and accounts being compromised? What am i doing wrong?"
CRedit,"I use rocket hq to check my FICO score, and I had 2 hard inquiries added and my utilization went up to 82%
What happened?"
CRedit,"Was informed from my lender that I needed to delete Experian Boost items from my report as FHA requires them not being listed (if an FHA loan is the route you're taking) to buy a house.

I was pleasantly surprised to find how easy it was to remove them as if they've had a shit ton of requests and decided to make it easy to do online."
CRedit,"I disputed a few late payments on my credit report for USAA, I included the dates (within last 12 months) of the payments being disputed...

At the time of the dispute I had 9 late payments over the history of the loan (4 years)...

USAA went as far back as the date of the original loan (4 years) and reported a bunch of late payments..

My history of 9 late payments turned into over 20!!

What should I do.?

I also disputed two (2) charge-offs from 2016... not sure if they just took me to the ringer due to still owing them for the two (2) charge-offs...

Any advice could help...

I used to be in the high 700’a before my job lay off in the fall of 2016... been trying to rebuild ever since... I’m financially better off now...  but with shit poor credit even making close to 10k a month don’t mean shit...

TIA"
CRedit,"So this is a general question about credit. I have been rebuilding my credit for the past year now, and it’s gone from a 480 to a 661 (or so I thought). I decided it was time to get a car loan to I could diversify my debt and fast track my credit improvement. However when I went to the dealership, when they ran my credit it came back at 560. 100 points lower! 

Does anyone know what could have happened or why there was a 100pt spread from credit karma. I understand they use vantage score 3.0 which is a different scoring model.... but 100pts?!"
CRedit,"I need a laptop because I’m getting into the stock market, would financing a laptop build my credit? Idk how it works, they should’ve taught us this in high school lol"
CRedit,My Fico (Experian) is way higher than my Credit Karma(Vantagescore 3.0) scores. Is Fico more important than the ones on CK ?
CRedit,"I managed to get my credit score good by using my card to pay for things I have to buy anyways and paying it off in full twice a month. [My Fico score.](https://ibb.co/q1XWXC7) I never let there be a balance before the card reported to the credit agency for the month. The capital one card had no reward system and was more or less a credit building card. I'd buy groceries and gas as you have to buy them anyways and more or less immedietly pay it off on the app. 

I have never owned a credit card with any sort of cash back. I got this card as I have one child in college and another a senior in high school and both are driving. I intend to use the American Express card to buy all my groceries and gas and have the kids to do the same and pay it off in twice a month same as I did the other. I have to buy this stuff anyways so I'm not creating debt buying things I can't afford.  I will then hopefully earn enough cash back that it will cover some of or most their monthly gas costs for their car 

So long story but my point is how does this work? Do I have to let the balance stay for a certain period each month to earn the cash back or does it occur just with the purchase? Do I actually get 6$ per 100$ spent on groceries? Does it accrue at the end of each month? Does the cash back go onto my card as a credit or is it something I have to spend on certain things in their shop? Sorry for the amount of questions but I'm a person who typically hasn't used credit thru my whole life and I'm 41."
CRedit,I had credit karma awhile back and it said I didnt have a  credit score . I make decent money I work full time . I have applied for secured credit cards cant never get approved. I do have a check and savings account .any tips please
CRedit,"Yes I know Credit Karma only check 2 bureaus and uses Vantage scoring not FICO. That Part I get.

&amp;#x200B;

I check CK and on my Transunion it shows 731 and Equifax 730 it has slowly but steadily been going up from a 680 back in 2016. I have A Credit One card I used to help rebuild my credit, it says my score has changed so I log into the app and it says my score is 667!  I log into my Capital One account because they provide a free credit score and my score on there FICO says I'm at 735!

Now I get worried but surely Experian couldn't be that far off from the other 2? I create and account login to Experian check my score and they come back with 671! I start going through the report and all the information seems to be correct, then I notice I had a 30 and  60 day delinquency back in 2014 from a capital one account that I paid off. That's the only difference I can see in any of my reports.

&amp;#x200B;

Could this really drop my score from the 700's the other credit agencies show on FICO to the 671 on experian?? I did the Experian BOOST and its now sitting at 675......

I'm supposed to be buying a house next year and I've been working really hard to get my utilization down (8.9%) , Hard Inquiries total 4 with 3 of those becoming 1 year old in October 2020 (I purchased a car last year, but decided to not finance it and just paid cash), Ontime payments have been spotless for over 3 years, Age of oldest account 9.8 years. Everything I can think of to do I've done.

&amp;#x200B;

Will this screw up my chances of getting a house next year? The 2014 late payments should fall of in 7 years so do I have to postpone my house buying?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any other way to boost my Experian Score?? I was fully expecting to finish out this year with a 740-760 Credit score to aid in my purchase...

EDIT: I checked Discover as well and it said 671 before the boost same as Experian."
CRedit,"I filed a dispute with Equifax regarding an unauthorized inquiry on my credit. I filed the dispute and the website says I’ll get a response in 30 days. What does Equifax do when investigating the dispute? I have documentation proving it was unauthorized, but during the filing process the website didn’t ask me to upload anything. 

I called Equifax and the woman was not understanding my question so I gave up on the call. Will they contact me for more information? I don’t want them to deny my dispute because there wasn’t any information provided. 

Any help would be great, as this is my first time filing a dispute.

Thanks!"
CRedit,"Really could use some help/direction from someone who is informed about this because we can't seem to get anywhere with this issue...

Long story short, my fiancee and I are trying to buy a home.  Our credit is pretty clean, utilization under like 10%, maybe even 5% for him.  However, he left an apartment 4 years ago and they stuck him with a cleaning fee after he moved out.  They notified him of said cleaning fee on the 22nd of the month following via email stating he had 15 days to either dispute or pay or he would be turned over, which he disputed.  However, on the 31st of that same month, it showed up on his credit report as a collections which was 8 days after he was notified.  He wasn't even aware of any of this until months later and of course, it was too late then.  

Fast forward 4 years later to today, and our mortgage broker needs his credit to a 720 to get us approved.  The collection remains on 2 of the bureaus and we need it off of at least 1 and he will get about a 50 point boost.  The collection should not have been sent when it was in the first place.  We have disputed with the apartments, the collection agency and the bureaus.  Apartment and collections say they can do nothing.  Collections continues to verify it as accurate every time and refuses to provide us with documentation as to how they verified it as accurate.  

We have since been referred to a home loan assist place that supposedly is working on getting it removed but I can't get a straight answer as to what their process is and we are going on 2 months with them and no results.  The apartments have told me they are not even able to verify any of the information as they have changed systems and no longer have the info.  The collection agency of course, just verifies they were given a debt to collect, and the credit bureaus are literally violating the Fair Credit and Reporting Act as far as I can see.

We have thought about hiring a credit attorney to get this taken care of but I'm worried about spending a bunch of money for more of the same, someone saying they can get this taken care of with no results and just waiting.  This is the ONLY thing standing in our way of purchasing a home and have to be out of our current place in a matter of months forcing us to move yet again if we can't get this resolved.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!"
CRedit,"I have the Discover Student card and that’s it (I’m gonna apply for a new card soon), and I pay off all my transactions every few days. My FICO last month was 771, but in my most recent statement it dropped to 759 and I’m not too sure why. I spend within my means, and I’m not too concerned about the drop, just curious as to why it happened. Any tips to keep boosting my credit, or am I doing all that I can at the moment? Thanks!"
CRedit,"I will preface this by saying I have Never missed a payment and always pay the full amount on my credit card. However, I do have a fluke collections account on my credit report for a medical bill that was paid over the phone but was apparently never told that the payment didn’t go through. Also the bill went to my address that I didn’t live at anymore after moving out for the summer at school so I had no access to it. And the excuse to not contact me was that they had the wrong number. The only way I figured out about it was an email notification that a collections account appeared. Also, as soon as the error was recognized, It has since been paid and was only like $130. So the question is, is there a way to get that off my credit report before I apply for another credit card, which I am looking to do, because I was in the mid 700’s but that instance dropped me 100+ points. Thank you for reading and taking time to answer!"
CRedit,"Hi all - thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Quick and dirty is that I had an account with a large US commercial bank that went into charge off while I was working with a debt relief service to negotiate with that bank a settlement amount. Turn the clock 4.5 years ahead and I finally got a program in place with said bank. Made 2 out of 12 payments and all of a sudden my score drops by almost 80 points from 760ish.

Does this have something to do with my recent payment going from 4.5 years ago to as of last month and therefore moving the 7 year right off date back up? 

I am trying to determine how this happened and what I can do to get back to mid 700s+."
CRedit,"So my score has taken a beating over the years due to young and dumb decisions (like most people). I’m at a 680 on my FICO 8 and I want to fast track this as much as possible and found a company similar to Self but with more options for specific financial goals

I make good money so I decided to do their highest tier called MAGNUM 18000 (funny name). Suitable for those who want to boost their scores fast for high limit credit tradelines and also be able to apply for commercial lines of credit in the future.

Wondering if anyone has had any experience with them and what was your experience? I did a search before posting this and all I saw was people talking about Self Credit Builder. I have them as well making my third payment this month to get their credit card.

Thanks for hearing me out."
CRedit,On both Experian and credit karma my home equity line of credit is showing up as credit card debt. I was approved for 40k and used the whole 40 to remodel my house. It’s showing credit utilization at 100%. Is this accurate and how it’s counted or is there something I can do to change this?
CRedit,"I just checked my Vantage credit score last week and saw it had gone down 50 points from 801 to 751. There was an item on my report for a debt of $162 from a collections agency and I had no clue what it was for. I called them, and it was for a router that I didn't return to Spectrum when I moved just over a year ago. I received no phone calls or emails about the debt (though they apparently had my email address on file). I was told notices were sent to my old address and not returned as sent to the wrong address. I paid the amount immediately and was told it would come off my report after 30 or 45 days or something. I asked the debt collector how it would affect my future credit score, but was told they are not trained on that and didn't know. 

Will this have a negative impact on my score for the next 7 years? Is there any way I can dispute the claim since I was unaware of the debt until it went to collections? My score isn't exactly in the garbage now, but I had a not very good score a few years ago due to a debt from when I was very young and have been working steadily to bring it up to what it was. This is quite upsetting. I would have paid the debt right away if I was aware of it. Just wondering if there's anything I can do. Any information or advice is greatly appreciated!"
CRedit,"Hi!

As the title says, anyone have any experience/feedback or advice to share on using a shopping catalogue to build credit history? Anything that could go wrong?

P.S. I have no chance of getting any credit card, no bills in my name, being self employed-pay going in Starling business account so no bank to offer me a credit card.
  


Cheers!


Edit: I tried eligibility check with CreditKarma, ClearScore, Experian, MoneySavingExpert and other eligibility checkers before but couldn't find anything over 40% chance of approval.

Now I just checked directly on CapitalOne and I got approved for the Capital One Clasic Credit Card with a limit of £200, they say card is on it's way. Yay!"
CRedit,"Hello!


I'm currently deployed in Afghanistan right now. I've been here for almost 7 months. I would pay for Spectrum internet back in the rear. I never missed a payment. 


I just looked at my credit score and it dropped ONE HUNDRED POINTS. I was so confused and scared and it was because of a negative mark (first negative mark ever on my credit score)


I didn't know what it was from until i went through TransUnion to see that it was from Charter (Charter owns Spectrum) and it was a debt for $300. I was pretty postive that i had put a pause to my service before coming to Afghanistan but i guess not.


I never received any emails or calls regaurding the accumulating debt from my spectrum account for an internet bill for a service that i'm not even using.


Where do i go from here? Do i call spectrum or do i file a dispute through TransUnion? Is there any hope of me getting this negative mark removed from my credit score? I feel completely lost. Thanks in advance."
CRedit,"I’m 24. Graduated from college 4yrs ago. Im just starting to build my credit

I have 12 student loan debt accounts that I haven’t paid since school. 

My report doesn’t show that any accounts are in collections, however 

I received a letter in the mail from another  collection agency saying that i owe them for the debt.

Do I start paying on the debt, 
or do I write a letter of verification?
I hear sometimes it can make the situation worse.

Thanks in advance"
CRedit,"This is a very simple question, and I ask you to be patient with me.

For over two years, every purchase I made on a daily basis (restaurants, groceries, bills, etc), I paid with my credit card (no annual fee) for the simple reason of not having to carry cash. Every time the statement came out, I paid it 100% - that is, I never carried the balance over to the next month. Now that I tried to finance a car (credit score 680), they said that I don't have credit history, meaning that I've never really used my credit card.

How to build credit through a credit card? Should I not pay the statement in full? Let's say if the statement is $100, how much should I pay/how much should I carry to the next month? I appreciate any suggestions."
CRedit,"Hello!
I’m a university student who currently has 3 credit cards, all of which are active and paid in full each month. My score on credit karma dropped a bit after I got my third card back in May to 742 and it’s been the same since. I checked today and my score is now suddenly 777. I haven’t made any payments in the last week so I’m not sure why the sudden increase."

CRedit,"I am helping my grandfather consolidate his debt so he can pay it off sooner rather then later.  We just finished looking at all his accounts and credit cards.  He has a bunch of accounts from stores (cardis, lowes, home depot, etc.).  I am trying to figure out how much of a hit his credit would take if he canceled a few (or all) of those store branded cards - they vary in age.  He would still be left with a few cards (capital one, citizens, BOA, etc.), maybe even a new 0% balance transfer card.  Just wondering what peoples thoughts or experiences with this is?  Thank you all in advance."
CRedit,"....I've spent the last 3 hours on the phone with Capital One and Equifax... title basically says it. 

Capital One says they have been reporting the card for over a year since it was opened in June 2019. Equifax says they cannot request Capital One send the report. I finally got frustrated and asked Equifax what I'm supposed to do if they can't request it and Capital One says they're sending it, and they hung up on me. 

I have filed a dispute, so I guess we just wait and see what happens. Anyone have advice on other steps I should take?"
CRedit,My husband’s credit has always been 760+. He has zero debt pays off cards every single month.  (About 30k of revolving credit). He had a huge ongoing medical issue last year And we received over 50 bills in the mail. He ended up missing one for $150 and it went into collections and hit his credit. We paid it immediately but Now his credit dropped to 650 and will not come up. This was been about 3 months ago. He has 20 years of a 750+ credit score and now we’re purchasing a house and don’t know what to do! I have a 7k collection debt on my credit and I’m over 750 (much less credit history and my credit was 600 about 5 years ago) so I just find it so odd. Is there anything we can do?
CRedit,"Please excuse me if I sound incredibly stupid, I’m just learning about everything. So, I can’t find my sscard in its unusual spot and am worried that it was one of the items taken during a robbery. This was a few months ago. I had faith that it was just lost somewhere in my house because I didn’t notice any unusual activity on my bank, but now I know that it isn’t my money they could be after, but my name and my credit. I’m fairly young so I didn’t even know I had a credit score without a card...lo and behold, I go to check my score to make sure it’s okay and it appears my report is either frozen, locked, or blocked. I can’t make an account or access my score anywhere. Did a thief freeze my account? Or could it be frozen because of debt or something else? I don’t even know what the next step is but calling the police, the bureaus, and the list goes on. TIA."
CRedit,"We will be looking to buy a house soon and this payoff still is lingering even though we paid it off. Any advice?

CRedit,"Hello all,

I've recently applied for a credit card and was denied to ""THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INQUIRIES"" and the only inquiries i've done was shop for auto rates at different dealerships in MAY 2020

Before Auto Inquiries :**1** (Chase bank / approved)

After Auto inquiries: 5 (ALL auto inquiries within 2 weeks)

FICO SCORE: 745

AAoA: 5 years 2 months

Total # of credit cards: 4

Income: 65,000

It's my understanding that all auto inquiries would count as 1 inquiry if it's done within a certain time frame. So any clue as to why i would be denied for having too many inquiries?

How long should I wait before I apply for another credit card?

Thanks CRedit community"
CRedit,"Hey guys,

Got a few questions that probably apply to others as well!

Need both a vehicle and personal loan at the same time for various reasons. Not a lot--about 7k for private used car sale, 3k personal.

Score is solid (704) and I make about $5k per month. Very low living expenses. Problems are:


-Self employed

-Havent filed tax returns yet for 18 and 19 (extenuating reasons; about to file shortly)

-Even if I had filed, it prob wouldn't help. In 18 I made good money but in 19 I basically made zero. Been consistently earning $5k monthly for about 5 months now but that's only this year.


Anything I can do to maximize likelihood of qualifying? What institutions are most likely to approve this? I'm willing to pay a little bit higher rate if it means I get approved on the first try. Typically I've used USAA for car loans previously.

Thank you!

Edit: I actually can provide the complete tax return forms. I just technically havent filed them yet. Kinda doubt they'd check with the IRS"
CRedit,"How to build “installment loan history”?

I love installment loans and in the future want high fico low apr online loans.

The problem is, you cant have most loans without installment loan history... but, you cant get an installment loan to get the history! I hope this makes sense of its a conundrum."
CRedit,"I had an issue with a lease I had to break a year back and was put on collections for the lease break fee of $8,000. It was already reported to collections and I haven't really made any payments on it as I am still planning on contesting the amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have 3 credit cards (Chase Freedom, Citi, and Discover Students). My cards are close to being maxed out right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had to relocate for school recently and took out some money I had from my savings. I have about 6,000 right now and I'd like to use some to improve my credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be more beneficial to pay off one of the cards completely or take some off of all 3 accounts. Also, I am not sure how helpful it would be but, I am pretty sure I could do a lump sum payment for the account in collections. Last time I spoke with them they agreed to take 3k. 

Would it be best to just pay the collections amount? If the account is already in collections, damage has been done correct? So I am not sure if it would be the best move."
CRedit,"I applied for my first credit card and got denied several times. We continue figure out why until we saw my credit score; it was very, very low. But I've never touched my credit before now. Then I remembered my mom opened accounts in my name as a child and she is historically awful at paying. What can I do about this? I'm moving in four months."
CRedit,"I only have one thing on my credit history, It is from an urgent care visit. I Co-payed with my insurance, I did not follow up to make sure the insurance payed, they did not pay, and it went to collections in 2016(the visit to urgent care was in 2015). I have attempted to contact them multiple times this year via E-mail, and left many voicemails. I have not gotten any responses. I no longer live in the town where this creditor and collector is, there business hours are not listed so driving 4 hours doesn't seem like a normal option. I can pay the 210 in full, curious on the advice on how to approach this.

My credit score is 552 according to credit karma, the above mentioned is the only derogatory mark. Everything else is ""no data"" or ""0 accounts""

I want to start building credit so my girlfriend and i can buy a house at sometime in the next year. I work in restaurants, so my past income has not been tracked in full on my W-2. 

From the cursory research I have done so far it seems like i should apply for a discover it secured credit card. Use it frequently, put it on auto pay, and do not exceed 30% of the max. 

I am also interested in other ways i could increase my credit without credit cards. I.E. Personal loans, Lease agreements/rent? etc."
CRedit,"There is a installment loan I have that went to collections so they sold the debt to another company.
The installment loan is still hitting against my credit even though there is a separate entry for the collection agency it is now held by.
It looks like I'm being hit twice for the same thing.
Should I dispute the installment loan still hitting me as I no longer owe that company?"
CRedit,"I want to buy a house next year.  What is the best option for monitoring credit?  Right now I pay through Experian and get my 3 bureau report along with FICO 8 and it does give me my other FICO scores like FICO 2, which I understand is the one used by mortgage lenders.

Is it worth it to also sign up through myfico.com?"
CRedit,"Hi guys,

Long time lurker, first time poster. I come to you guys looking for advice as a fresh college graduate.

I am going to be moving to an extremely competitive housing market in San Francisco where a lot of landlords are really stingy with credit scores.

I have been pretty careless with my credit cards, I make the minimum payment every month (which is just paying off the interest) and thats it. I don't really use my cards that much but am still holding onto a balance.

According to Credit Karma - **my transunion is a 636 and Equifax is a 633. My FICO score is currently 648.**

One issue that caused my utilization to shoot up is Paypal unexpectedly lowered my credit line from $3000 to $900 without any warning which made me go over my balance as I had about $910 sitting on my card, this understandably tanked my score. I have since **paid this entire account off as of writing.** Paypal never really explained why they reduced it, but it hurt my scores.

**Balances:**

Discover Card - $2740.38 @ 15.99% APR. Credit Line is $3000. I need to get this paid down.

Paypal - $910 @ 24% (i think) I have since PAID THIS OFF - but it hasnt shown up on my report yet.

Total Credit Lines combined --&gt; $3900.

I have been holding onto this debt as a college student because I have been studying full time so I was unable to pay off a lot of it. I understand I made some poor financial decisions but I will be starting work in 2 weeks in Consulting/Accounting so I will have a solid paycheck coming in, I've just been treading water until I start working.

**My question is - should I apply for a Personal Loan on Credit Karma so I can just get this Discover card paid down to a reasonable amount, or should I just wait until I start working and make larger payments on my Discover Card?**

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR --&gt; Holding a high balance on discover card, want to improve scores. Considering getting a personal loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks guys!"
CRedit,"Not sure if this is the reddit page for this, but I just signed up yesterday to be a member with TransUnion so I can get a credit report. However it won’t show my credit report, saying that “Online identity verification system is temporarily unavailable”. I’m not sure if this is because I just signed up and it takes time, or if there’s another issue."
CRedit,"So I was reading here you have 180 days to pay from the time it's due. If you do so within this window, it won't get reported to bureaus. https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/credit/score/can-medical-debt-impact-credit-scores/ I see it's been sent to collections but it's a week away from being 180 days(174 days using a day counter). Will I still be able to avoid this if I pay this week?

Edit:

I also read another article that says it's 180 days **from the time it was reported** to collections:

https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-long-does-medical-debt-stay-on-your-credit-report/


Does it mean I can wait another 6 months from now? really hope I can as I lost my job and trying to get by. I would like to pay when I'm in a better financial position. Does anyone have any experience with this?"
CRedit,"Hey, y'all. I have two relatively small medical bills that were sent to collections a few years ago that I was unaware weren't paid by insurance, and I move around enough that I missed them. One is $190 and the other is in the $300s. I'm honestly fine with paying both of them, but I'm wondering what the best way to go about getting them deleted from my credit report is. Should I send a pay for delete letter in this scenario, even if I'm not necessarily trying to negotiate the amount?

ETA: I just found these on my credit report yesterday, and I'm fairly certain they are valid from looking at the details and matching it up with some other things I have. I haven't made any contact yet."
CRedit,"Backstory- as a teen I made some stupid mistakes and had a total of three missed payments. Right now my credit score is 640 but I’m desperately trying to get it better. 

I started a company a few months back and so far we have been profitable- I got approved for a 2k cap one sparks business card and am just waiting before I start applying for more. 

My Amex I had settled “less than full Balance” if I pay it off completly ($200) will Amex report it as paid in full?

Discover isn’t budging with my payments unfortunately!

I also got approved for a trade line of $2k and a business shell card for $3k- my goal is to have my DnB score really high. 

Anyway I could use that to my advantage- the credit of my llc to help build my credit like it is with the capital one sparks? 

Thank you so much- all help appreciated"
CRedit,"My cousin’s an Internatonial student with ITIN # who’s looking to build credit. Boa told him to open a checking account so he can then get a secured card. 

I would love to help him build faster by adding him as an AU to my credit cards. Obviously not going to give him the actual cards but just to help his history. Have any of you done this successfully ? Or been denied because it’s not a social security #? Any feedback is appreciated."
CRedit,"So a couple months ago, I accidentally used my wife’s credit card to order a case of paper on Amazon. It’s a credit card she never uses, except for travel. She has never had a late payment. EVER. She did not check her statement until today. And found four months of late charges and her credit limit went from ten THOUSAND dollars to FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS and her EXPERIAN credit score went from EIGHT HUNDRED to SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE. Also, her dad co-signed that credit card (in 2004!), so her parents credit score dropped as well. She is understandably furious with me. We have to wait until Monday to talk to the Bank of America credit division to see what they can help with restoring her to her previous state. 

If anyone has any advice that can fix this in less than 7 years, I’m all ears!"
CRedit,I have processed a payment and this credit card always has an instant credit increase without money authorization. Tomorrow is Monday.. I should be getting my money into the bank. My checking account will be negative. What will they do in this case .. since I have used up the credit limit for something. Will they gjve me atleast 30 days to pay before sending to the collections or?
CRedit,"In May I noticed I had a collection account on my Transunion credit report with an original creditor of “Utility”.  I called up the collector and made an arrangement for a payment plan. I’ve been paying it off and I’m almost done. 

I then decided to have a look at my Experian and Equifax credit reports as well. I noticed then that the ‘Utility’  debt is listed on the Equifax report under a different collector ; with the full original amount shown.

Since I’m almost done paying it off with the first collector, what are my options for getting the other collector off my Equifax report?

Any good suggestions would be helpful?"
CRedit,"Hello! First I’d like to say thank you for taking the time to read my post, I know this is long but I will try to keep this as straight to the point as possible while still providing as much information as I can. 

I’m 25yo and on the road to repairing my credit, and right now I’m feeling a bit stuck/confused on what I should do next to help myself here. I’ll try to lay my info out as simple as possible.

First and only credit card is with Bank of America, it is a secured credit card with a $500 limit. I’ve had this card since January of 2018.

The only other thing on my credit is a medical bill that went to collections that was $378, this account was opened Feb. 14th, 2019.

I have ALWAYS 100% of the time made my credit card payments on time, never late once, although I will admit for about a year it was sitting at about $400 used of $500 limit, just recently have I been able to bring that balance down to $0 every month. So my credit utilization right now is 0% which has helped my credit score. 

The collections of $378 was recently completely paid off in one large sum, in hopes that it would also help my credit. On certain credit monitoring services, it did the opposite. It dropped my score drastically.

Right now my credit score from BoA which uses TransUnion and is a FICO score is sitting at 620 (9 points lower than it was last month before paying off the collections).

On the other hand, my TransUnion score provided from TurboTax is 734 (up about 50 points after paying off the collections).

I have 0 credit inquiries which is good. I have 1 derogatory mark which is fair. I have 2 other medical bills that went to collections, but I stopped them and payed them before they were reported to the credit bureaus so nothing else should come to haunt my credit.

About a month ago before I paid off the collections and my score was 629 from BoA, I attempted to have my secured credit card switch over to an unsecure credit card and have my limit raised to $1,000, to which I was denied. The lady on the phone told me that it would look better if the collections balance was $0, which is really what sparked the idea to pay it off. She was wrong cause my score from boa dropped.

So given all that information, the only thing I can seem to get approved for is another secured credit card from discover. I applied for the Apple Card about a month ago and also got denied (I’m trying to finance a new MacBook). But I’m wondering if it would be a smarter decision to try to get a loan from my bank, that way I have different types of credit?
Also, I’ve read places that writing a letter to the collections agency and asking them to stop reporting it can be helpful so I plan on trying that in hopes that they might see my credit card payment history and be able to work with me. I would love some advice on what I can do in this moment to raise my credit score, as I’m feeling a bit stuck. I’ve seen people with worse credit history get approved for things I feel like I would get denied for and that’s disheartening.

Thank you!"
CRedit,"\- I just opened a new credit card because it said 10% back on my purchase if i open the card today at an electronics retailer.

I already called Citi Card to increase my limit and they said NO.  not sure why when I have perfectly fine credit. . ."
CRedit,"Hi. This is my first time posting here so sorry if I made some errors, please let me know if you find one.

I am now a Junior in high school in Southern California as a South Korean international student (NOT an exchange student), and I am getting a green card soon because of my mom’s investment thing in San Fransisco. As stated in the title, I am 17 year old and turn 18 next July.

While looking things up on Google, I found some ways to get my credit scores higher and one is churning. Take a look at what I wrote based on all those things on Google and Youtube:

——————————— THESE ARE THE THINGS I WROTE DOWN ON MY NOTE———————————————

1. Get a Chase bank account in prior to getting a green card and SSN as an international student. Use the savings account and have a certain amount of money in there for at least 6 months

2. Wait until I get the green card and become a legal permanent resident. (I think this will be around my sophomore year in college)

3. Make a secured card from USBank/ Citi/ Chase/ WF/ BoA/ Capital One/ Discover and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 750-790 is expected, but a fragile one.

4. Get a CF or CFU and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 800 or near that is expected, but still a fragile one.

5. Get credit cards from each companies (Amex, Chase, BofA)

After 6 months, I would be able to lease a Honda  Accord or Toyota Camry (Maybe?)

- The credit score can easily go down, so I have to have a mortgage or a car loan to make it a sturdy credit score
- Try to do things above online not on the phone or in person unless the bank calls you or bank wants you to call them
- I can use other cards from Korea or use my debit card when I can’t use my credit cards because of the limit

———————END OF THE NOTE———————-

What do you guys think about this? Please let me know and help me fix this if anything’s wrong here."
CRedit,"I just signed up, and voluntarily gave a lot of information. But I cannot find any information about this company so now I’m kinda nervous and iffy. Anybody know anything about them?"
CRedit,"Hello, y'all!

For the longest time I have heard (kinda in passing) that there is a specific window of time in which you are supposed to pay your credit card balance in order for said payment to substantially help you improve your credit scores. The only thing I know for sure is that I always pay my \[lone\] credit card balance before the payment is due. That has always been my one ""strategy"" to ensure that my credit is solid, BUT...I keep sorta kinda hearing that there is a more specific way.

Do you know what I am talking about? Or is this all something I somehow imagined?

If this helps, my payments' date due is the 14th of the month (I usually pay the bill around the tenth), and my credit card statements documenting the whole thing come out on the 17th. The statement usually has, say ""July 18 to August 17, 2020-31 days in billing cycle"" as part of the text. 

Is is true that based on WHEN you pay, you can actually help your credit scores get better every month, as opposed to simply stagnate in the same number month after month (even if that number is decent)?

Anyway, thanks for any and all advice!!!"
CRedit,"The last few months I have finally been earning more than enough money to pay off all my bad debt, I've also been learning more about how credit works and how to bump up my score. I had about $7000-$8000 in credit card debt, and got that lowered down to $2600 in a matter of a few of months. This is across 4 cards. I thought making small chunks would benefit my score more than paying them all down completely at once.

After paying down that debt and disputing a couple of other collections, my score went from 550's to 670 FICO for pretty much all 3 bureaus. Im now at the point where I have about $2600 left in credit card debt across 4 cards (each at about 10%-15% utilization or less), with one of the cards being one that was closed due to late payments. The balance on the one that got closed is $1363. (Funny enough when it got closed, my score went up, but nonetheless its still showing as current and being paid)

I think where my main problem is at the moment is an auto lease at Hyundai that I turned in back in 2018 and never made the final ""lease end payment"" (Always on time with the regular monthly payment for the 3 years I had it) This ended up turning into a charge off after never paying it past the 30/60/90. I went ahead and paid the amount in full recently which was for $2000 on 08/12/2020.

I tried to apply for a Tesla as of this past week as this was one of my main goals, and got denied through their leasing/financing and also got denied at Alliant CU as well. The Hyundai thing was mentioned as one of the reasons for not getting approved (since it still has not dropped of my report). Disappointing but I guess this is expected, but was trying to give it a shot.

At this point I am unsure of what to do. I will be sending goodwill letters to both the credit card that got closed, and Hyundai to see if its possible to get the late payments and charge off removed.  My question is, is there anything else I can do at this point to bump up my score? Should I make a payment to zero out all my credit card balances at once, or keep paying small chunks on each one with the small balances that is left on them?"
CRedit,"Hey everyone! I am new here and I’m happy to see so many people discuss the improvements they made. I’m going to try to keep it short but I’m mostly looking for advice on what you would do in my situation. Here it is:

I have student loans that I have good history paying. Everything else is in collections. My report is showing $25,000 in debt. Where do I even begin? What are the first steps you would take to rebuilding and reestablishing your credit? I want to start negotiating my debts and pay them.

CRedit,"
Credit karma is telling me I have a 567 transunion and 598 equifax credit score. On the experian app, it says my score is a 627. I’m not sure why the scores are so scattered apart but I just want to get my score in the 750 range at the very least. 

I have an auto loan with 10 months remaining. This account is killing me. It has 9 late payments! I have been up to date and on time for the past 9-10 months. The late payments are scattered from 1-3 years ago. 

I have a capital one card which I opened in may 2020 with a 300$ limit. It is increasing to 500$ for September after making payments on time.

I started the credit builder on the self app in June 2020 and been making payments on time.

I got approved today for the discovery secured card (200$) and that should arrive in the mail in 2 weeks. 

My credit utilization is at 5% at the moment but it’s typically around 10-15%. 

I have 1 account in collections just in  my transunion account which i disputed because I had them agree to remove it. Account was opened feb 2015.

Then I have a child support account only on my equifax account with 43 missed payments!! This account was paid off but also terminated by a judge on July 2020 and the other credit Bureaus removed the account but not equifax. I also disputed this account for inaccurate information. 

So what else can I do? I feel like I am stuck. I want to purchase a home next year but my score sucks. I know I’ve made mistakes in the past but I have been doing well to correct them. I just don’t know what else to do to increase my score. Please help"
CRedit,"3 months into trying to get Ally to correctly report  to Equifax and TransUnion, I have just received the dispute completion report from Equifax (submitted on August 5th), I am awaiting the dispute raised with TU on the same day.  I don't anticipate it will be any different.

&amp;#x200B;

It is still wrong.  Despite speaking to Ally 5 times over the past 2 months and them asserting they had corrected the information, they are still sending incomplete and incorrect data.

&amp;#x200B;

The info in dispute is that they are showing both January 2020 and February 202 payments as delinquent by 30-59 days.   They were paid on time, as all 26 monthly payments have been.   The report sent by Ally to Equifax on 8/27 reiterates this false data, however also shows the following : 

07/20 No Data Available

06/20 No Data Available

05/20 No Data Available

04/20 No Data Available

03/20 No Data Available

02/20 No Data Available

01/20 No Data Available

&amp;#x200B;

I have checked the statements online with Ally and they are all wrong too.  The amounts, payments dates and outstanding balances are all messed up.   However, the payment history section is actually entirely correct.   A screenshot or printout of this was not accepted as sufficient to correct Equifax or TU held data.  They needed to have this confirmed by Ally, which as above, was not done.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I called Ally and they said they would raise another case and it would take 45 days to sort out so I then spoke to a supervisor who said they would raise this with ""executive office"" and I'd hear within 2-3 days.

Myself and my wife have scores 50+ points below the would-be accurate score.  We have been declined for a mortgage when we were fully expecting and planning to move house this month.  We have had to unpack stuff, cover $10000 in rent until the end of the year and it has been incredibly stressful.

As per FCRA and as per FTC -  [https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5b4b390fda578523776c98e77dbb2ab8&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt16.1.660&amp;rgn=div5](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5b4b390fda578523776c98e77dbb2ab8&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt16.1.660&amp;rgn=div5)   


I did mention FCRA violations on my call to Ally on 5th August.

As they have failed to remedy this, are we good to sue?  Has anyone done so previously?

CRedit,"I don't know if this is the right sub. I just came across this video in which the guy says, 'don't pay the collection because you haven't signed a contract with the collection agency'. It further claims, 'you shouldn't even identify yourself when on calls. There is a statute of limitations and your collections go away after a while'.

I wanted to know people's views here. Is this a good strategy? Should one be doing this? "
CRedit,"Hello everyone! This is my credit story: My parents took out 3 federal student loans in 2010 for my education. They ended up falling on hard times around 2015 and allowed my 3 student loan accounts to enter default. They kept this a secret from me while I was living abroad after college, and I found out around January 2017 when I came home. I should have been more responsible for my finances back then but I guess lesson learned. Don’t trust anyone else with your finances. Fast forward to now, the loans have been rehabilitated and are out of default. They have been transferred over to Great Lakes as of January 2020 and I’ve been making payments despite the forbearance due to COVID. 
Also, I have a Capital One Quicksilver (recently converted from a Platinum) with an $850 limit that I’ve had since June 2018 and paid every month on time. 

I recently paid for Experian to give me all of my FICO credit scores from the 3 major bureaus, and I was surprised to see the range in outcomes. Experian: 806 Transunion: 694 Equifax: 673 

Experian is no longer reporting the past delinquency of the student loans, but Transunion and Equifax are and it’s clearly lowering my score for them. I guess my question is simple, Why? Is there a chance that I can have the delinquent/closed accounts taken off of my record? Any insight would be great, and sorry for the long winded post."
CRedit,I’ve been a victim of debit and credit card fraud within the past two weeks (on 8/18 and 8/29 respectively.) Now I’m worried that someone has stolen my identity and might open up accounts in my name! I’ve already reported the fraud to Wells Fargo. Now do I pull my credit monitoring reports — or will it be too early to show anything? I’m not sure what to do. I’m 25 and know very little about this. I don’t know how this happened for each of the cards when I have them in my possession. What else can I do to check if someone has stolen my identity?
CRedit,"Tldr; Have an installment loan (flooring) with WF. Was laid off from COVID. Enrolled in their Pandemic Forebearance a week before my due date. WF reported me as 30+ days late to all bureaus. Only sent apology, says reporting accurately. Starting mailing campaign to fight this. 


I have an installment loan through Wells Fargo with Empire Today flooring out of Michigan. Ive never missed a payment and haven't had any issues. On March 1st, I was put on furlough (unpaid) from my career of six years. On April 17th, I missed my first payment with Wells Fargo. I erroneously believed that I had made my payment. Fully my fault. I realized that the payment was NOT made on May 11th and immediately called Wells Fargo to pay and catch up even though I really couldn't afford to. 

Spoke to a representative who told me that if I signed up for their ""Pandemic Forebearance Program"" I wouldn't have to make a payment for three months. I specifically asked would this include the payment I've missed already and assured me that he would suspend all required payments to the account. 

Forward to June 1st, I get a credit alert that my Wells Fargo account has reported 30+ days late for April and that my account was CLOSED. I immediately call Wells Fargo and speak to a 'less than helpful' representative who said in other words; your SOL and that its reporting accurately and my Forebearance didn't start until May. I asked to be escalated and the next representative repeats ver batim the exact same info. I tell the representative I want out of the program and I will make my accounts current and paid for April, May and June.

I end my call and immediately begin disputing with all three credit bureaus. I also file a complaint with the CFPB against Wells Fargo. Disputes end with the status quo; Valid Reporting -- Customer Disputes. CFPB on the other hand sends it to investigation. Forward to August 27th. I receive a a call from Wells Fargo. 

Wells Fargo apologizes for their error in closing my account. Says they've reopened my account. Says they understand that there was a level of miscommunication however they stand by the fact that because there was a missed payment in April, that everything is reporting correctly. I go nuclear. Wells says they will reinvestigate. 

Do I have any further recourse? I've decided to mail them ten letters a week, and I've reached out to our local news station about being taken advantage of during COVID when I as worried about feeding my family and making my mortgage payment.

Any help would be appreciated. One missed payment, killed my Credit Score. Dropped me 110 Points. Ruined my financial future for the next two years."
CRedit,"I'm a 22 Y/O male in the US. (Sorry for format on mobile) My credit has been damaged ever since I maxed a credit card at 18. (1k limit with Discover) up until October 2019 my credit was in the 530~ area according to Credit Karma.

In October 2019 I opened up a $200 credit card (that has since increased to $500) and a few months after applied for a secondary card. For almost a year now I have kept my utilization at 10-15% at all times. 

My credit has been completely stagnant for the past five months or so, at 620~ moving up and down a few points every now and then. 

The three credit lines I have: 

1) Discover - Closed (1.1k debt)

2) Capital One - $500 Limit ($450 available)

3) Credit One - $500 Limit ($450 available) 


So I guess my question is how should I go about it to get into the mid-high 700s? I see two options ahead of me and am wondering which one is the correct move.

 Do I continue to apply for cards/loans to increase my lines of credit? 


Or


Do I hold off on applying for anything and just continue to pay on these two cards?




Also; I believe I have another 3 years left until the discover cards falls off of my account, but also have the ability to pay it off. Will paying it off be a more positive effect than it dropping off?"
CRedit,"Hello I'm 18 years old and live in the UK. I really want to start building my credit rating but clearscore still shows only a question mark for me.

I've had multiple accounts for a while at multiple banks and just got my first credit card. I pay my car insurance and phone bill and now have my student account and will be taking loans from SFE. I will now also be paying for my accommodation at university. I'm also a codirector on a business bank account. 

Can somebody help me understand why I still don't appear to have a rating and what i can do next? Soz for grammar"
CRedit,Hello I need some knowledge and advise. I just filled for BK Chp7 3 days ago. Experian just reported the bankruptcy public record rd my my report and my score took a hot. I'm now sitting at a 589 credit score. Will my score drop even lowered again when the BK gets discharged? My 341 meeting is on the 16th of Sep. Or is this the only major drop when filling?
CRedit,"I have five credit cards in total

1st card has a credit limit of $600 (first credit card)
2nd one has a limit of $2000
3-5 all have a limit of $1000

On one of the $1000 limit cards the bank doesn't offer credit limit increases and the other $1,000 card will do a hard pull if you ask for your credit limit increase. So I have tried getting an increase on the first three cards but I have been unsuccessful and I'm not entirely sure why, the banks for those three cards are Bank of America, Amex, and Capital One. I have never had a late payment although I did carry a balance on two of those cards for a while because of certain circumstances but as of now I have paid off all my credit cards in full. Another thing is I rarely use the cards. So my question is does lack of movement and almost never charging anything to the account affect my chances of getting an increase and also did caring a balance for a few months affect my chances? Income is now $55,250 and has been updated on all accounts. Will charging more expenses and paying them off in full every month help?"
CRedit,"Equifax recently removed my closed student loan accounts. They were about 5 years old from closure. I believe that is before the sol and they should probably typically still be on and Experian and TransUnion still show them.

However I'm not asking this to dispute it as they had late payments and I believe it has helped my fico 8 score as Equifax is now by far the highest (although can't be sure as I don't have a history of the scores to compare). 

I'm just wondering if there is any obvious reason for this to happen for future reference."
CRedit,"I'm trying to learn of the best ways to improve my credit score.  I just reviewed my transition report/score.  I have one item in collection, approx. $190 to a Hospital collection agency.  My score is in the mid 500's and is that way because of several factors.  #1. As a dumb young kid, I opened two lines of credit.  Maxed them out but never paid a cent on them.  Fortunately, those collections/debts are no longer indicated on my record because it's been well over 10 years since the lines of credit were originally opened.  The downside my score is extremely low.  I just opened a cell phone line and am going to use that as base to begin rebuild, however what other options do I have to improve my score fairly quickly.  I will answer any questions as they may arise to help find solutions.  THANX"
CRedit,"I got an email and it says that the dispute was completed and the item was deleted from my report. But when I check it, I can still see it there.  I’m really hoping it did get deleted because that one account was almost 3k and accounted for more than half my debt.

CRedit,"I have a great score, but on my Chase free credit score page, powered by Experian, it shows my mortgage and car accounts as ""revolving or bank card balances"" and says they are too high.

I know I'll have to write to them since they won't talk on the phone, but I'm curious to see if anyone else has this issue."
CRedit,"So I finally have the money to pay off my debt with wells Fargo collection. They sent me an offer for a  lump sum settlement of 471$ from an Account Balance of 785$.

CRedit," 

It's too late to contact anyone, but I'm freaking out, so to reddit I go....

Bought a new truck on July 10, 2020(2020 GMC Denali HD, we aren't talking BHPH specials), trading in a leased 2018 Ford F150. It's now August 27, 2020 and I start getting credit notifications and I go and look....Ford just reported to the credit agencies that I am delinquent....they are missing my July 23 and Aug 23 payments.....no kidding, I traded the truck in on July 10.....what the hell do I do? No one has called, no emails about missing payments, nothing, no indications that something was up.

I am not sure who screwed up here, but it certainly wasn't me. I am going to get on the horn with Ford and the GMC dealer in the morning, I am tempted to be waiting at the front door of the dealership in the morning to ask wtf happened.

At a time like this.....with everything going on, I do not need a deliquent account on my damn credit report. I got into some credit issues over 10 years ago, everything has cleaned up and I was a 724 when I bought the truck, my FICO(yes, FICO, not FAKO) has dropped 84 pts over this deliquent account....I figure these things aren't easy to reverse, even though it's an obvious mistake I had nothing to do with.

Should be noted that this deal is fully funded, I am already making payments to my credit union on the new truck, fully registered, I have my half of the title(Maryland splits titles between borrower and bank), hard plates, and I have already driven the new truck 4,000 miles."
CRedit,"Can’t qualify for Apple Credit but score is fine...?

I have moderate credit (between 700-720 for all 3 scores) and relatively good income (~$120,000) and no other outstanding debt except for mortgage and moderate car payment, but cannot seem to qualify for the Apple Card. This means that I have to pay for the next iPhone I get outright (or more specifically, 2 iPhones one for me and one for spouse), and this stinks. Is there a way around this? Mobile provider is AlticeMobile so no option for provider upgrade (and I like to go thru Apple anyway). Can you still get citizenOne? I had good experiences with those loans. Thanks in advance."
CRedit,"I was looking at my credit and I noticed this comment on a charge. Back story of this charge: it's a joint charge that shouldn't be on mine at all, I disputed it and had it removed through CK, then saw it on Experian and disputed it there. Then it was back on my Equifax report on CK, and not removed from Experian. Is it possible the joint person is doing something and causing issues, I'm not sure what the resolution means here? This collection agency has also yet to send me anything except an offer to pay half, so I'm just really confused

Basically, what does this phrase mean? Why is it on there? And anything else you wanna give me I guess"
CRedit,"Is it weird to have collection accounts show up on Vantage (via Credit Karma, etc) that don't appear on your FICO reports?

Is it worth it to pay those off if they aren't appearing on FICO 2 or FICO 8?  

Also, is it better to pay the original debtor than the collection agency?"
CRedit,"I had a CreditOne balance that was sold off to Resurgent Capital Services. I've recently started visiting this sub and it looks like one of the most important things in regard to collections is to confirm that it will be specifically ""deleted"" from your credit report. When I go to their portal, it says this:

*When your payment* ***resolving*** *this account is processed, a request will be submitted to the credit reporting agencies within 30 days to delete the tradeline associated with the account.  If this account has not yet been reported to the credit reporting agencies at the time your payment* ***resolving*** *this account is processed, it will not be reported.* 

Is this sufficient? Does the equate to deleting the record? Does anyone have any experience with this collection agency?"

CRedit,"Hello all,

I'm working with a mortgage lender who gave me some direction last month on what we could do to boost our credit scores prior to applying for a mortgage within the coming weeks. Primarily it was to pay down some credit card balance. So we've done that, mission completed.

So I've been calling around to some card companies that are more than 10 days away from reporting as of today. I've run into 1 pain in the ass company that refuses to send an update, credit one bank. They even suggested I dispute my balance with the credit bureaus to force credit one bank to make an update. Like wtf?

Has anyone ever run into this before? How can I get them to update without hassle? Literally just need the update so I can apply the 2nd week of September at best."
CRedit,"Hi all,

I'm still educating myself on how all this works and hope this isn't an odd question with an obvious answer, but I appreciate any advice you can offer. I am trying to figure out if it will hurt or help my credit score to remove my authorized user status from my parents' credit card. I'm also wondering if it would benefit me to open a new credit card to increase my available limit/decrease overall utilization (maybe I would do that instead of remove myself?). I've listed my active accounts below for a quicker overview:

—JPMCB Credit Card - $20,000 limit, $7,000 balance. Est. 2005. Authorized user. 

—MasterCard through our credit union - $3,000 limit, $0 balance. Est. 2013. Joint credit.

—Navient-owned student loan - $10,000 remaining balance. (about 30% paid off) Est. 2007. 

—Auto loan through our credit union - $13,000 remaining balance (about 20% paid off) Est. 2019 (over a year ago, so no hard pulls in at least 1 year)

—Capital One Quicksilver Rewards - $3,000 limit, $0 balance. Est. 2020. Authorized user. (Not currently displaying on the report/reflected in the score yet because it was recently opened.)

No missed or delinquent payments on any accounts, active or closed. No account ever sent to collections, active or closed. (I had various federal student loans and one Best Buy card which were all paid on time and have since been closed.)


Here are some details for context (pulling this from Experian since they include the balance on my parents' card):

I was recently notified of a 22 point drop in my Experian FICO score due to Loan Balances. I have an auto loan and a student loan that make up about $23,000 in loan debt. Current FICO is 788 (which means I went from Exceptional to Very Good and as a constant over-achiever I'm kinda bummed at the drop in status, even though I know it's still really good!). There's not much I can do about my installment loans besides continue paying them off on time. I’m not sure what prompted the drop but that’s a question for another day.

Anyway, it got me wondering if there’s anything I can do to improve the score. My parents' card is the oldest item in my credit report (opened in 2005), because back in the day they added me as an authorized user to help me establish my credit. They have never missed a payment. However, there is a standing balance on the card of about $7,000 (credit limit about $20,000). This balance is keeping me at an overall credit utilization of 30%. If this account were not included, my utilization would be 0% (or maybe some small percentage depending on the MasterCard balance at the time of the report).

I know there's no exact science to it, but as far as I understand there would be pros and cons to having me removed. Pro: that standing balance goes away from my report. Cons: that extra $20K credit limit also goes away; my next oldest account is my student loan from 2007 that I'm still paying down and then my joint credit card from 2013; it makes my file ""thinner"" as I don't have many credit cards; overall credit limit goes down.

Comparing the pros and cons would normally make me go, okay, too many cons, but am I missing something?

I don't typically have a standing balance on my credit cards because my husband and I only use them for things we can pay down immediately with our bank account. So I'm not concerned about my credit utilization going up due to a drop in total credit limit. But I am concerned about a lower overall credit limit if I get taken off my parents' card, and the fact that it's the oldest account in my file.

I've rambled on long enough. Like I said, I'm trying to educate myself and make the best decisions for my credit, so I truly appreciate any advice or feedback. I want to be sure I'm making wise decisions and taking action if/when needed. Thanks in advance!"
CRedit,Hi guys I’m new to this sub and have fairly good credit up until today. 3 years ago I applied for and was granted a secured loan for some tools I needed for my job. The loan was for $3000.00 and I never missed a payment ever. 2 weeks ago today made my final payment on it and I was happy because of all my on time payment and age of the account made my credit go up about 80 points. Fast forward to today I get an email from credit karma saying my credit score decreased. I open credit karma and sure enough it had decreased by 64 points because the tool company closed the account. What can I do to get those points back?
CRedit,"So, I haven't applied for a credit card yet and i'm 20, but I was always enticed by the individual cards and their bonuses, like for amazon prime and paypal. I didn't know that applying for these and getting denied hurts your credit, and I thought because I haven't had a credit card, only a debit card for until now, I didn't have a credit score.

Covid knocked my job out and it's been really irritating trying to find another one since, so now I don't think I can even try to remedy the (5?) denies with a secured card or some promotional. How screwed am I?"
CRedit,"First post but I need advice. Trying to build my wife’s credit so she applied for an Amazon store card so that she could get a laptop for online classes she just started. 

She was approved for $1200 from Synchrony Bank and we picked out a laptop. It was over the $1200 limit but we figured we’d pay the extra with our debit cards. Amazon’s cart wouldn’t give us that option but it did allow us to pay with 12 egual payments. Figured if it was ok with them then we were ok. 

Next day wife got an email saying the order was rejected. Ok. Over limit we get it. Picked out a laptop with only 1TB for under $1200. Wife forgot she bought $40 headphones on credit card. Order got rejected. 

Ok third time is a charm. Ordered smaller screen for under $1100. Order accepted. Next morning Amazon account is locked. They want her to prove that she is the account holder and authorized to use Synchrony account. 

She answered all personal questions they asked and sent email from Synchrony accepting her application for credit. Got email saying proof was a insufficient. Synchrony says they can’t help her. Dont know why. Don’t know what to do. 

So now she is stuck with a credit card that she can’t use. My question is how big of a hit will her credit take if she cancels the card? Can Synchrony transfer her credit to one of their other cards(Newegg?). 

I know this isn’t the most informative post but any ideas would be helpful. Wife is in tears because she thinks her credit is shot."
CRedit,"Hi all,

I'm brand new to this sub and to credit repair in general.   My score is currently at 570 (and rising, slowly, but rising).  I have settled 4/6 accounts in collections and am working on the remaining two.  I have a loan out (through Self), and just added a secured Visa through CapitalOne.  My plan with these is to establish good credit history and utilization (I will keep it under 10%).  My concerns are that each time I paid off a past due collections account, my score only improved 3 points each.  Is this normal?  Will it take years to get my score above 700?  Are there any ways that I can increase my score faster, other than what I am already doing?  Any help would be much appreciated, and thanks for your time."
CRedit,"I am shopping for mortgage loans to refinance my house. I found out that I had an 18 month old utility bill that was dinging my credit. I had a quote for a good rate, but thought it would help if I could bring up my average to 740 to get quotes at the “better” tier score. So I made the $54 late payment to So Cal Edison to remedy the past due balance.

Lo and behold, this payment I made triggered a negative impact to my score of 56 points to my experian reported Fico 8 score. 

I am livid about this. Experian reps told me that it triggered an event that otherwise wouldn’t have been triggered. They claim they can do nothing about this. Trans union and equifax were not impacted, maybe since it was a Fico8 impact only.

I can’t begin to explain how upset I am that this $54 payment can cost me literally thousands of dollars since I am now getting a much worse rate quote for refinancing my house. I do not understand why there are so many different credit algorithms that a mortgage rate can be impacted by MAKING A $54 utility payment! 

I have 18 years of mortgage payment history, no late payments. I have 2 late credit card payments from 5 years ago. The stupidity of how inaccurate these credit scores are with estimating risk of borrowers is astounding to me.

I need to vent about this, but I am also hoping that there is someone out there that can offer any advice on anything I can do to reverse this 56 experian point drop. Anyone????

TLDR- made a $54 payment on an old past due utility bill which dropped my score by 56 points, causing thousands of $$$ in extra monthly and upfront costs to refinancing my house"

My question is if my parents decide to remove me as an authorized user on their credit card, will my credit score drop?

I'm confused because on the Experian app it shows both credit card accounts as active accounts but on Credit Karma it only shows my USB credit card. Also how come the scores are so different?"
CRedit,"Hello, first thanks to any and all who are willing to write back and answer a few questions. I am a disabled veteran and my wife and I have made some errors on our credit because of poor mental health. Including late payments, and medical collections. Recently admitted to myself that I am unable to work because of physical and mental limitations and received a VA back pay. So we paid off all of our collections and credit cards. We also recently sold our house and made a small profit and are in the process of looking for a home. However our credit is below the threshold of qualifying for a va loan. Currently we have no credit card debt, only my wife’s student loans And her car which the payoff is less than 5000. My wife is at a 618 and I am at a 614 fico 2 middle score which was pulled 7/30/2020. We have some liquid cash from the sale of our home. How long do we have to wait for our credit to raise to above 620-640 to purchase a home? Is there anyway to apply some of our liquid cash to speed up the process of our credit getting better? Is there a solid person or company that could give us credit counseling without selling us a bunch of horseshit. We have already been down that road with credit Saint."
CRedit,"Her goal is to get back on her feet as soon as possible and hopefully purchase a home in a few years.  Should we pay directly to debt collections or go through a debt settlement company? Her credit score is impacted already but could doing either be better for her credit score?

also any thoughts on not paying to collections at all..."
CRedit,"Hello, 
I am a 26f who made some awful mistakes with credit cards at a young age. I got my first credit card at 22 and since then I had started racking up credit to the point where I have an American Express credit card at $12,500 and a Chase card at $2,300. I am terrible with money and always have been, but I didn’t understand that even if I made every credit payment on time, it would still hurt my credit tremendously having this much on only two cards. I didn’t check my credit score until it was too late and I am at 600 (credit karma). I am terrified and also horrified for my parents to find out. I always knew that the job I would get out of school would put me at making at least 80,000-100,000 grand a year. Unfortunately I have become extremely depressed due to school stressors and my credit card debit, that I have put myself and my future into jeopardy. 

I currently have about $4,000 in savings and am I living at home with my parents. I don’t have a car payment or any other bills really at this time, but I don’t have an income either. I am currently studying to take a Board exam since I graduated college. Due to my depression and constant anxiety about my debt, I have not been able to prepare for my board exam and will most likely have to retake it in November, which means I will not be able to get a job until at least December in my field. I am planning on applying to jobs after this first test in two weeks, so I hope to start making an income at that time. I am getting help from my partner, but he is only able to give me about $200 a month, or half of my monthly payments (which is amazing within itself). 

Soon I will need to get a car and I am terrified that my credit will keep decreasing and I am not sure what to do about it at this point. I have applied to remote jobs online to make some extra income, but I feel like everything is crashing down on me at once and I’m not sure what to do. 

I am going to start selling my old clothes and whatever else I don’t need. I also have decreased my food budget. Basically I have no bills currently either. Probably $150 a month for food and $240 a month for therapy. I will need to start making student loan payments in November (total of about $60,000), but my parents have offered to help me with that until I can get a job in my field. I can’t tell my parents about my debt, because my mother had made the mistake of racking up $10,000 on a credit card without my father’s knowledge and he almost left her. I don’t know how I didn’t learn from that, but I didn’t and I am in a huge mess. 

Is there anything I can do to stop my credit from declining? Any advice? I made horrible mistakes that I will have to continue to pay for awhile and I am aware of that. I am horrified that my parents will disown me and stop helping me if they find out about this mistake, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Any advice on legally making a decent amount of money on the side? 

Finally, if I die, will this debt be passed on (I am not married)?"
CRedit,"So I recently almost bought furniture a month ago at Gardner white but didn’t still a credit card being opened is on my account . My credit was 772 and just from this 1 inquiry and my score dropped 40 points. Will this stay on my account very long, or will my score go back up in a month? I’m so confused when usually hard inquiries only drop scores by 10 points at most. This is a FICO score according to credit Karma- Transunion and Equifax. I didn’t end up buying furniture from them so this is confusing."
CRedit,"In the last couple of years was building my credit back up, so much so that we’re approved for a very nice house. I have two cards a credit one and a capital one card. I only use the capital one and it has a very low limit. Today I was approved for a discover card with an extremely high limit. I don’t need the other two, but especially the credit one. I don’t want to pay a fee anymore, so should I cancel it? Or should I wait to cancel it till all house paperwork is done? Thanks in advance."
CRedit,"I had a phone plan from 2018 places in collections. In 2019 I had disputed it and surprisingly it was removed from my credit report. It even made my score go up. However it was placed back on my credit report a few weeks ago and it’s stated as opened in June of 2020 even though I haven’t used that phone plan for quite some time. I’m wondering if it’s legal for a collections to be placed with a new date and should I dispute it, leave it alone, or pay it off? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
CRedit,My wife requested a card for me from 2 different credit card companies because we were told that it would raise my score... so far it hasn’t been detected. When does it start? Do I need to purchase something with the card? Is there more than just getting a card to being an authorized User?
CRedit,"I just got an email from capital one claiming they've reduced the credit limit on one account by $5,000 from the original $10,000 ""to better match my usage"". I realize this is going to negatively impact my utilization ratio and score, has anyone else dealt with this crap? Can I call them and have them put it back the way it was?"
CRedit,"Hello, I am recently separated with $3000 on a shared credit card.   


I got a invitation in the mail to transfer my balance to a card with 0% for 18 months.   


I'm am thinking of transferring my half of the debt to this card to pay it off faster. There will be a 3% transfer fee from the new card. Will there also be a transfer fee from my old card? I saw my old card said 25% transfer fee so I hope not.   


I know this isn't a divorce sub but is this a bad idea to do it before the judge puts it in place?"
CRedit,My husband and I want to buy a house next year.. we both have FICO scores in the high 500s. Most of the accounts on my score are medical collections except for one payday loan and two car payments (those two car payments are the only items helping my credit because I've never had a late payment). Recently I disputed most of the medical bills through experience and five of them got removed. Will my score reflect those removals? Experian showed that they weren't high impact. I'm trying to get a credit card to help raise the score and I keep getting denied. I don't want to keep applying because I dont want a lot of hard inquiries. How can I raise my score?
CRedit,"I’ve never put any thought into this and frankly I have always assumed it didn’t matter what kind of card you have. A credit card is a credit card.

However, a few things have me thinking. First, MyFICO gives me updates about report changes. It singles out retail cards. As in I receive notifications that state, “your retail card balances have decreased” while I will simultaneously receive alerts that might say, “your over all credit usage has gone up” and “your balance has decreased” and then list which card. It always lets you know about retail cards by static retail card.

Second, in MyFICO’s simulator they list opening a new credit card and retail card as separate items that you can simulate.

Lastly, one of my credit cards provided FICO score summaries lists what’s hurting and what helping your score. One of the things that is supposedly hurting me is “consumer credit account”. Now, I don’t know if it’s talking about a personal loan or a retail card. Sounds like it could be either.

Regardless of the last item, I find the first two things a little odd.

Really the only retail cards that I have - I use for store specific discounts/rewards. Such as synchrony’s Amazon card and my wife’s target and old navy card."
CRedit,"I have some credit card debt I need to pay off. I also have about 2 k in medical bills that I keep getting messages to pay. Would I be better off paying the medical bills on another card so it is just paid off and not worry about it and then work on the credit cards from there?
I was hoping to pay off credit cards this year but I have not been able to make any dent in it bc of covid and my income being cut it half. 
Any recommendations on how to tackle 9K cc debt and 2 k medical bills needing to be paid?
Thank you"
CRedit,"Hey y'all. So I just got on a plan for a 1,000 debt I forgot about in April. I could probably afford to just pay the whole thing off now, but I thought maybe I could just get on a plan and better my horrible (low 550s) credit with some on time payments. My question is, do I have to wait, generally, to pay my debt every month with this to improve my debt? Or like, tomorrow could I post another payment, and the next day, and that would also positively affect my credit? I'm new to this whole thing. I muffed up bad when I was a kid and am trying to rebuild. Thanks for the help everyone!"
CRedit,"Hey folks, I am new to the subreddit and began exploring the various methods of improving ones credit score. I literally just read about Pay for Deletion and I recently (less than 48 hours ago) paid off an old credit card in full that was over two years old, so like the title suggest I am able to call the company and ask for them to remove the remark from my credit profile?"
CRedit,"I have 3 collection accounts on my credit report all have a 2 yr age

Comcast collection $226

ad astra recovery services (speedycash) $1458

Auto repo collection $15k

I'm in the process of buying new home first time using my VA Home loan im 100% rated disability with SMC

My Fico scores from lender

Experian 524    Equifax 648    Trans Union NA

I've have no credit history ive heard 660 is the ideal score home loaners look for. So far I've opened a CapitalOne Secured Card which I will keep utilization under 10%. Ive paid the Comcast collection to be deleted. Ive started a Self lend account for $48 a month to help build and establish credit.The last two collections i am unsure on what to do. I can pay the speedy cash collection but I really don't want to but ive read they are well known for PFD. The Auto Repo im undecided to pay it down or just let it fall off. Ive learned in Texas where I live laws state  ""four-year statute of limitations on debts"" does this mean in 4 years from the first collection date the collection accounts will be removed my credit report.
Is there anything else I can do to help build up my credit score and any advice on what I should do with the 2 remaining collection accounts what will work best for my situation."
CRedit,"I am currently planning my wedding and decided to apply for a Discover It card to take advantage of the 0% promo they have. I was approved, but for a lower than expected credit line. I called Discover to ask if there was any way to review or increase the line, but they do not do that until the account is open for 12 months. Instead, they were able to give me a 0% promo on the existing card I have with them, which has a significantly higher line of credit. My mistake for not looking into that first, but I now no longer want this new account. 

Discover rep I spoke to 2 days ago said I can call and cancel the account before it gets reported. I called today and the rep said they report everything. 

So my question is: if I close this account immediately after opening it, will my credit be negatively impacted? Should I just keep the card open? 

TL;DR - applied and approved for new cc account, no longer need/find beneficial and want to close it. What will happen if I do?"
CRedit,So I made some terrible life choices and racked up credit card debt. I have been paying most of it off but something odd (or so I believe) is that the collection accounts are not appearing on my credit report. Only the original creditors are so there is nothing indicating that I have actually been paying these accounts off other than settlement letters from the collection agencies. I assume having these accounts updated to reflect they were settled/paid would help a bit. Just not sure if this is possible at this point. Any advice?
CRedit,Anyone know how to travel completely free w/o MR points being used? I watch this guy @credit post a lot about it on Instagram. I don’t wanna pay $1000 to get into a course and find out.
CRedit,"When I ask for a supervisor, they refuse and hang up. Or they start asking me when I will pay my balance."
CRedit,"I don't have a student loan or mortgage, just credit cards and I was wondering if I should be able to see those in my credit karma app in case someone opened one. Thank you"
CRedit,Has anyone else been able to use Experian boost with USAA? I can’t get it to work. Is boost even worth it?
CRedit,"Short and simple
Had a delinquent account never updated on my credit report was deferred at the start of this corona stuff finally got enough money to pay in full 7-17-2020 disputed the account on 8-10-2020 because the creditor never updated experian came back with a paid charged off yesterday 8-25-2020.why is the creditor allowed to charge off a account that was already paid 1 month before."
CRedit,"I’ve read that delinquencies stay on credit reports for up to 7 years. I get that part. But will my credit start to recover before then? If so, how long does it take for me to see my score to start improving?

For example, I had two 30-day delinquencies in Oct and Nov 2019. Do I really need to wait for 2026 for my credit to recover? 

Thank you."
CRedit,"I did not open any new accounts, and my report reflects that so I don't suspect fraud.

I did recently close a few joint accounts due to divorce, one with a $7k limit and $3600 left on it (I was allowed to close it with a balance and keep making my fixed payments), and another with a $500 limit and zero balance.

Maybe with a few recent small expenses that adds up to close to $4400 but if that's the case, why would it tell me my debt owed increased by that amount rather than my total credit decreased? I promise, I did not acquire $4.4k of debt recently and being told I did is so alarming.

Am I missing something?"
CRedit,"This is what it shows on all the credit apps. What could my real score be? I know this has to be inflated but I have been building my credit since I was 18. I have a small loan I’m making on time payments, 2 credit cards I’m making on time payments. Never missed a payment or was late. How soon can I expect my credit score to even out if I keep building my credit?"
CRedit,"I have old debts that are going to fall off in about 1.5-2 years.

The more recent acquired debt/collections are much more manageable to pay off. I am wondering if I should dispute to verify that I actually am responsible for the debt (which I am) since I hear that sometimes, collectors can't verify the debt and therefore removed. Should I go this route for all my current debt to see if it's worth a shot?"
CRedit,I'm new to this and need some help if possible! I have $50 grand only in medical debt:( due to my son coming early and being in NICU for a month. I had insurance from my job but it didnt cover him for some reason...and I didnt have state insurance either...does anyone know what I can do this was back in 2017 I'm now not in that state anymore btw. I have  a school loan that is current and I have a savings through self as well. Any tips or pointers to building my credit and fixing it at the same time?
CRedit,"I’m thinking I need to wait at least a month for this to all be updated on my various credit reports, but if that’s not needed then I’d love to get going on a mortgage refinance application. Anyone have experience with this?"
CRedit,"So I have two medical bills from two years ago that the hospital apperantly didn’t bill Medicaid for but me instead. They sold it to eastern account systems? How can I get these removed?

Those are the only two things on my report nothing else and they total 1200 dollars. I’m a stay at home mom and everything is in my fiancé’s name but would like to start building credit and this is bringing my score down to 560.

CRedit,"Back in December of 2018, I applied and was approved for a loan for a new truck. For some reason I didn’t think until now to check my credit and what exactly made up my hard inquiries. It turns out, I have 9 separate hard inquiries (all for the truck on December 22, 2018). Is there a way to combine these to reduce the hard inquiries to 1 as opposed to 9? This is one of the category dings to my credit score.  
  
For clarification: these scores are vantage scores as seen on Credit Karma."
CRedit,"Hello everyone!

I need help figuring out how to fix/raise my credit to buy my first home.  I apologise, I'm a little naive, or for lack of a better term ""stupid"" when it comes to credit and how it works so anything that can be explained in layman's terms would be very much appreciated.  I'll try to be as specific as possible, sorry if I miss anything.

My credit score for TransUnion and Equifax (according to credit karma) is 666.  My Fico score on Equifax is 558.

The bad on my credit:

\-Upstart Loan Charged Off $2000, Opened 2/19

\-Affirm Loan $646 Collection Account, Opened 1/19

\-Capital One Credit Card Charged Off $945, Opened 2016

Besides those I've never had a mortgage loan, auto loan, medical bills, student loans, or any other credit cards. Also I have done the Experian boost but currently the only consistency I have is my cell phone plan, it only helped my credit about seven points. Also I have tried disputing the loans but it came back and said the information was accurate.  So a couple of my big questions are, in order to help my credit, should I pay these off as soon as possible? Will they take a lower the amount? Is it possible to ask them to report to the credit bureaus? Should I take out a secured credit card to help? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. if I've missed anything or if you have any questions that I can answer please let me know. Thank you for looking!"
CRedit,"What’s the fastest way to deal with my thin credit file. I’m 44. Never owned a home because I live in NYC. I’ve had the same credit card for 25 years with 25K limit (5% utilization). I ignorantly closed my other 25yr personal card when opening my business/business account with its own card.  
Never financed a car, now I want to buy a used car and the best “pre-approved rate” I got was close to 8%. 
I went into the bank for a second card last week and was approved for a 10K limit card. If i really needed to I could buy the car in cash, but figure that it could  be a good credit building opportunity. 
Open to any advice. I was thinking I would go on a card frenzy and open up 2 more immediately to thicken file so I don’t stay in this position. Advice always says wait 6 months between cards. But is that necessary?"
CRedit,"My dad, bless his heart, meant well by adding me as an authorized user on credit cards years ago to help build my credit. He lost his job a few years back and maxed them out, then later paid less than what was owed and the credit companies closed the accounts out. I got three derogatory accounts taken off my credit report since I disputed that I was only an Authorized User and never even had any of the cards in my possession. One card that was taken off was in good standing and had great credit history, however I didn't want to take a chance that history would repeat itself.

I'm looking to buy a house in \~8 months, my question is should I get a credit card now to help get my credit score and credit age up? Is 6-8 months enough time to recover from the hard inquiry? I have no credit cards myself, no collections, I only have a student loan in good standing sitting around $38k. Steady job as an engineer, so I feel like I'm in a good place for a credit card, I just am so lost with this credit stuff, it's so finicky (with good reason, I get it). Current MyFICO score at 660. Looking for some advice and encouragement :)

Sidenote: I've had several people tell me to buy jewelry and get some credit that way. 1. I don't wear jewelry really. 2. How is that different from getting a credit card?"
CRedit,"Hi there,

So I've been on the hunt recently for a roommate / rooming situation, and there are a lot of regular joes out there posing as landlords (who might very well be landlords) that are asking for a LOT of personal info unencrypted (SSN, credit report, sometimes even a DL number). I'm taking a pause on the roommate searching situation for other reasons, so no one is getting my info for at least a month or two regardless.

Now, I already requested a credit report on [freecreditreport.com](https://freecreditreport.com) (dumb, I know, should've gone to annualcreditreport instead, learned after the fact) and entered the last 4 digits of my SSN, and it got me thinking: where else have I slipped this info over the years? 

I've been looking into freezing my credit, because I currently have one credit card open and will not be opening any lines of credit + making large purchases anytime soon. I'm pretty private + social media free so most basic info is devoid from the internet besides my LinkedIn (which is as private as anyone can make it), so I'm not doing a terrible job but with my low maintenance style of living, I want to know a couple of things before potentially freezing:

1) Is this a good preventative measure worth executing to protect identity theft? I've been reading enough to say that it is, and this is the primary reason I want to do it. Again I'm not a big spender and don't mind jumping through the hoops to unfreeze it every now and then (at the same time, I also want to have a better idea of how easy / difficult it is to freeze and unfreeze credit). 

2) Can I still accrue credit from my credit card if I freeze my credit?

3) How can freezing my credit hurt me? What are the cons?

Thanks in advance if anyone can help give counsel!"
CRedit,"All on time payments, student card."
CRedit,"In the past 3 months I’ve been using credit karma and got my TransUnion score up about 70 points (524 to 594) by getting 2 secured cards with $200 credit lines. I’ve been maintaining 10% usage and making payments immediately after usage. I also disputed one of the big collections I had ($4300) from back in 2015 and I received the alert today that it was settled and wiped from my TransUnion report, felt like Christmas morning. So my question is; what can I do right now to continue building my score? And also how can I find out who I owe money to? The accounts I have in collections haven’t tried to contact me in a long time and I have no idea who I would even contact to start paying these."
CRedit,"Long time lurker here with an Age of Credit question. I divorced in April 2016 and began my credit rebuilding journey then. I started that same month with three secure cards (4y4mo). Two years ago/later, I put down the max ($5K) on three secured Navy Federal credit union cards to fast-track building my available credit/low credit utilization component. Most recently I completed a year with the Apple Card. 

I discovered this sub one year ago and implemented your insights (paying off all but one account to zero monthly, diff between due date vs statement, etc.) and during the quarantine was able to pay down large amounts debt. My score has gone from 580’s in August 2019 to 730’s currently. Thank you all for your willingness to share.

As I turn my attention toward home ownership, I keep getting dinged with the same two things: Age of Credit (an average of 3y4m), which I understand can only be remedied with patience, and “Proportion of Loan Balances To Loan Amount Is Too High.” 

The loan is my final remaining student loan, which I’ve paid down to $1000 from $3100 within the past 90-days. It’s my last remaining debt from the dark years and I’m itching to pay it off. I’m reluctant because it is also my oldest account at 11y5mo and I’d rather not torpedo my score.

Should I pay it off entirely or pay it down to some magic FICO percentage, or move forward only paying the minimum so that I maximize the benefit from the student loan account’s age? 

Thank you in advance!"
CRedit,"Electrical Contractor performed work that failed same day. I repaired the work and made partial payment, via check.  He did not accept the partial payment and is now adding late fees and threatening Collections. We had no written contract and no established payment terms. He will also not return phone calls to discuss an amicable solution. Sooo,

A- can they legally charge late fees absent defined terms?

B- will the collections agency be able to report to the credit bureaus w/o my SSN?  

It's only a couple hundred dollars, but at this point is more about principal...

CRedit,"So I will start this by saying this is kinda of a long story,it’s about my girlfriend , and any information will help.


About four years ago my gf applied online to live at a apt complex designed for college students. She applied , was told she needed a guarantor so she asked her mom to apply. It came back that her mom did not get approved , so she just assumed that she wasn’t  going to get the place and moved on. Later on she got a notice about her move in date and where she was going to live . She was confused so she called them and told them she wasn’t going to live there , her guarantor didn’t even get approved , she never signed a lease to stay there and she couldn’t afford to stay there. They told her that her applying online was the lease and that she would be liable for a broken lease if she didn’t move in. 

So you can probably see where this went . She didn’t move in and they charged her 7k . It got sent to collections and now she has a rental based collections on her credit report. I’ve tried to dispute it for her using the basic disputes on credit karma and such but nothing has happened . 

I’m just taken aback that they could even do this . She never gave a deposit , never got a letter about evictions , never went to court and her guarantor even got denied when she applied . She even states that she never signed a lease , but thinks that when she “applied “ it must have been a lease too or something . 


Any advice on how to proceed? What to do?"
CRedit,"I thought I'd read everything about the affect of student loan refinance on your credit score, but apparently I was reading the wrong things. Here's how things went:

June19: 787

July 10: 782 (1 hard pull for refinance shows up)

August 15: 771 (My Navience student loan reports paid in full/closed)

August 22: 774 (Monthly credit card paid)

August 25: 740 (Earnest student loan reports new loan)

I'm so annoyed. Even our financial planner said I should look for a 5-7 point drop because of the hard pull, closing of long term account, and refinance). I have other accounts that I've had longer than I had my student loan. I carry about 7% on credit cards in general. Over the next five years I'll be saving about $8000 with my loan refinance, but right about now I'm just peeved. What did I miss?

CRedit,"I've been saving up to get myself Lasik as an early birthday present, because my lifestyle and work really do make having glasses a major inconvenience. 

Initially I was just going to pay out-of-pocket, in full, in one go, bingo-bongo and be done with it. However realizing that I have the money to pay it off in full Is also making me realize that I have an opportunity to improve my credit score which is in the high 700's. Which is my best avenue in terms of improving my credit score? 

1. Paying $2000ish dollars upfront, and putting the rest on my existing PNC credit card and paying it off there

2. Paying $2000ish dollars upfront and putting the rest on a newly opened line with care credit, and paying it off there

3. Paying it all off upfront without involving any credit cards.

CRedit,"I went to the emergency room after being in a wreck not caused by myself. The guilty driver's insurance has yet to pay the bill which was issued 6 months ago and because of that, the bill has been sent to a collection company.

CRedit,"Hey guys! Was hoping I could pick your brains on this as I am planning to move apartments (just renting) this coming October. 

Currently, my credit score has dipped to 642 (used to be 705) in the last year or so for a number of reasons. However, while the score is fair, I am concerned that some landlords might require me to get a guarantor when I apply for a new apartment. 

Would it make sense for me to get a personal loan now as I'm getting offers so I can pay off the credit card debt, in the hopes of increasing my score in time for the next month or 2? 

Not sure how it works...will I immediately pay off the debt with the loan they give me? Will even just getting a loan now hurt my current score?

- I can't use a guarantor as I don't have one. I'm Filipino American but both my parents live in the Philippines and no longer have US bank accounts/active credit history and if I were to use a guarantor, I'd only want it to be them.

- I'm apartment hunting in NYC.

- Income wise, I'm good. It really is just the impact of the credit score that worries me as I know they look into that first.

Any feedback is much appreciated! Thanks!!"
CRedit,"Hello all,

I have a $783 bill from AT&amp;T back from like 2017 after I lost my job.  I am on much better financial ground right now and was trying to clean up my report as best I can so I can improve my scores even further and get some decent rewards cards.  I’ve been doing fairly well with my two secured cards and self loan and have gotten up to about 642 over the past 8 months.  One thing that I think is hurting my score from rising even more is this AT&amp;T collection that is being serviced by ERC.  I believe att still owns the debt and they are just contracted.  

Since they “took over” in early 2019 they have been posting a late payment mark every month like clockwork since April2019.  Are they allowed to do this?  I never have had any contact with them since they started servicing in January 2019.  I never entered into any agreement with them.  Could I dispute it?  I do have more than enough money saved to pay their original settlement offer I just found in my collections/junk mail pile...or even the full balance.  If I could somehow get this purged I would gladly pay the full balance.  Would paying ATT be possible and then just disputing the negative marks?  I have been hesitant to inquire with them and make it even worse.

Thanks!  There so much conflicting info on the internet and I’d like to see what you all think."
CRedit,So... I negotiated a collection (AT&amp;T) and the debt collector sends a removal letter and deleted it off Exp (3 weeks ago). This past week I received more mail from them showing a late bill fr AT&amp;T and that evidence shows blah blah blah. I checked my report and the collection is back?
CRedit,"So I've had a credit card that was charged off in May 2019 (about $2500) after a layoff and brief period of unemployment. Back to work now, and I've been making regular monthly payments directly to the original creditor. The balance doesn't seem to be changing, and I don't seem to be getting credit for the payments (at least on my credit reports). Is this because the CC account was closed/charged off? Should I continue to pay? Dispute?"
CRedit,I know i have messaged a few people before but I am curious is it possible to have a credit card account in charge off and still have your other credit card with a different issuer still open active and uneffected ?
CRedit,"I recently decided to i was finally going to buy a house and checked my credit for the first time (at 27 years old, I know). My credit report shows 3 collections for unpaid medical bills that were reported in 2016 that I had no knowledge of.  I called the issuing hospital and they dont show any bills for me at all for :the amounts listed, the entire year of 2015 or 2016, and no bills ever sent to collections. I used credit karmas dispute tool and got an email back 6 hours later saying they had removed it. (That was last week, still hasn't been reported off). I used the credit karma tool again on the next one,which is still pending. Then i learned thats only for transunion, and I'd have to basically do this same thing for all 3 collections for all 3 major credit reporters. I have the money to call and pay all 3 collections off(not that I feel I should have to as they're all obviously some kind of mistake). Basically my question is: is disputing them or paying them off going to affect my credit score in different amount or at different speeds?  I'd like to get it up as fast as possible, but if one way improves it dramatically more with a few extra weeks wait time id be willing to do that. My credit score is about 580, my payment history is 100%, I have 3 accounts but no credit cards if that information helps."
CRedit,"I’m trying to improve my credit score as I’m wanting to refinance my home loan here soon and I plan on buying a car in the next 6-12 months. My FICO scores are in the 790’s per Discover and Synchrony Bank, but per Chase Journey’s VantageScore I’m at 718. AmEx says 722. Chase Journey has a score simulator that says if I add a credit card my score will go up between 14-26 points ($2,500 - $20k limit). However, I have 2 hard inquiries currently. Is the score increase worth it to offset the decrease from an additional hard inquiry? I have 15 credit accounts (only 3 with balances and $43k of available credit.

Not sure if you need the rest of the credit picture. 0 late payments, oldest account is 48 years, 23% credit usage ($12.5k/$55k). I have $7k of student loans, $7k unsecured loan for a new HVAC. I’m getting ready to pay an add’l $6k down on my $12.5k credit card balances (sold a car we were not using). This will leave only 1 card with a balance. It will be $6.5k and the credit limit is $21.9k (29.7% usage). Hoping that also helps bring my score up 20pts or so.

Lastly, I’m wondering if the score increase from a new card would really just be due to lowering my overall credit usage from 23% to below 20%, which I will already be achieving once I pay that $6k on my balances (waiting for hold on check to clear before I can make payments).

Any other suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance!"
CRedit,"I went from 745 to 820 after I took out a loan to pay down about $36,000 in high interest CC debt, so my util went from 49% to 1%. I suppose the score will come down once the $36,000 installment loan hits. I wasn't expecting my score to go up so much given that I still have about $200k in Student loans that are still nearly at original amounts. I’ve been working to get my score up so that I can eventually refinance my student loans. 

ps...I used payoff.com to payoff CC @ 6.65% for 36 months. My CCs averaged 16%"
CRedit,"Hello,

So I have a negative account on my credit that is from an old gym membership. However, it was on contract for 10 a month for 12 months. I think I made it 3 months in and forgot about it ( I believe I started working out with friends at another gym) and forgot to cancel it. 

It is showing on my report at around $500. Now, I would almost understand that if this was a gym that allowed you to workout even while late, but after 14 days late they stop letting you in and turn you away until you pay.

So how could they keep charging me for something they won’t allow me to use, and if its 10 a month for 12 months ($120) how could they possibly justify $500?

Anyone have any ideas or suggestions on how I should approach? Or anything I should research?

Thanks in advance."
CRedit,"I have bad credit. I have multiple collections, some credit debt. I just want to know what are some general resources to learn how to manage collections, settle, debt management, etc? Are there any actually good credit repair services out there that work? Thanks in advance."
CRedit,"(Sorry this is so long, 1st paragraph is backstory if you want to skip it) 

About 2.5 years ago I had a contract with a pest control company, but canceled it over the phone via their 800 number due to poor customer service by the local branch (they never answered or returned my calls). About a month later I recieved a charge on my credit card for the $100 quarterly service. I called the 800 number again and received a refund and verbally confirmed that my account had been canceled during the original call. A couple of weeks later I started receiving emails from my credit card company that the pest control company was attempting to charge $100. I called the local branch about 5-6 times then called the 800 number and was told it would be escalated and they would contact the branch and instruct them to contact me. I repeated this process every 2-3 weeks for about 6 months and never received any call from the local branch. After about 8 months from when I was originally told the contract was canceled, I finally received a call from a service technician who claimed a complete service had been performed about a month after the cancellation (which would have required me to be home to bring in my 2 german shepherds and open the locked gate to let their tech into the backyard), she then informed me that her manager had told her I had to pay. I explained the full story above to her, and she said she would speak to her manager and call me back, and that was the last time I heard from them, despite me calling their branch multiple times to follow up. 

About 6 months later (just over a year ago) I received a collection letter from an agency about the $100. I looked into what to do to dispute it, and sent them my dispute which included names, and dates/times, and details of all the phone calls, as well as copies of my credit card statement showing the initial charge, and subsequent refund for the ""service performed."" All the articles I saw said to send it as certified mail so I could prove they received it before the 30 days were up, so that is what I did. I never received any further communication from them. It has now been approximately 13 months from when I sent my dispute and yesterday I received a letter from a collection agency (I have to look for the old letter so I don't know if it is the original agency or if it is a different one) attempting to collect, complete with another notice that I have 30 days to dispute. 

Can anyone advise me on how to proceed? It was my understanding that if my dispute wasn't addressed within 30 days, it essentially meant I won. I know just writing down the call dates/times is kinda flimsy (which I assume is why they do everything through calls instead of email/chat). Am I supposed to dispute it again now or will that restart their ability to collect?"
CRedit,"So I’m really scared of getting a credit card cause I wouldn’t wanna use it but I know I need one to have a credit history. Either or next year I’m moving off campus with three friends and renting an apartment, that being said do we all do credit checks for the apartment? And if so what do I do having no credit? I don’t want to screw up anything especially being so new to credit. Unless one or two people all co-sign but I’m not sure. I just need some advice and knowledge about how it all works."
CRedit,"Hi all, first time posting here. 

I am 31 years old trying to really fix my credit (675)  but I’m in a position that I need to take out a home equity loan against my house. This loan will be used for some needed renovation costs before I sell my house in the next month or two, likely before October’s end. 

I am wanting to know how this may impact my credit overall. I would essentially be borrowing against for 2-3 months once the sale of the house goes through and I will pay back the loan in full. Discover doesn’t charge early payoff other than a maximum of $500 to reimburse closing costs.

What could I expect to see with my credit score potentially and what are some things I need to consider before and after this loan. What steps will I want to take to repair my credit after, what I assume, will be a drop in my score?

With this loan I will also be able to pay down or off of the following OPEN ACCOUNTS (6)
- Car loan (15% - age: 4.1 year)
- SELF small short lender CD loan (age 2 months)
- small amount collections X2 totaling $300 (age ~ 4.8 &amp; 6.2 years) 
- home loan (4.8 years) 
- credit card ( ~25% utilization age 8.3 years)

Also plan to save a chunk of it to make the first set of payments on it, so would paying itself back be a bad idea? One would think not...

Any strategic tips to help me be better on the other side of this home equity loan? 

Thanks for any advice!!!

EDIT current credit scores I am aware of based off the following services: 
Mint TransUnion VantageScore: 668
Chase Experian Credit Journey: 670

CRedit,"A bit of background, 

My wife and I are looking at purchasing a new home with a considerably larger mortgage than we currently have and would like the application to go through with minimal hiccups. The home is new build, in Canada and looking at a purchase price of approximately 850k

My score via CreditKarma is 817
Visa 18k limit, daily driver with between 2-4K monthly balance with one late payment in August 2017 (missed by one day), account is nearly 9 years old

Home depot card, 7k limit, rarely used, account 2 years old

10k line of credit (never used) account 6 months old, shows closed on my report, but still active with my bank

Car loan will be paid off in March 2021 ~5k left, account 3.5 years old

Phone bill that reports monthly, account 2 months old

My questions are, 

On some occasions my visa will reach 50% utilization (during renovations, large purchases etc.) but always paid off in full and I’ve never paid interest. Should I apply for a credit limit increase to keep my utilization lower and will this affect my score to apply?

How much would one missed payment affect my score? Is it possible to dispute since it was only a day late? 

Will my car loan closing negatively affect my score because of age of accounts changing?

Lurked this sub for a long time, and have learned a ton of great information."
CRedit,"Sorry - long story:

I'm currently living with my mom and I'm trying to move to a one-bedroom. Since I've been home, I've been repairing my credit from unpaid credit scores and a rent payment I didn't pay. I've brought my credit up from a 410 to a 625 according to Truebill a 614. I've been applying to apartments and have been getting rejected, and an apartment complex let me know it's showing up as a 394 as a credit score. I called the credit place and when they look at my report, all of the derogatory marks are the same as credit karma. One paid off the credit card for $1700 that's still on my report and my student loans, about 65k. They couldn't give me a score but said it shouldn't be enough to bring it that low. Then I paid $30 for an in-depth report and I get the same thing, A 615 at the lowest. 

I make about 52k a year, that paired with a 615 should be enough to get into an apartment. I asked the company for a credit report company to see in depth, but it's very frustrating because it's been a persistent issue and no one seems to be able to help me. Any advice?"
CRedit,"Hey All,

I am very fortunate that I have good credit and because of this I am very conscious of things that may impact it.

Generally I have a great handle on how different things impact credit but I have hit something that is confusing me as to how it may impact my credit if I do it.

The used car market is nuts right now, I have a lease coming up that us way under mileage and my residual is under the trade value of the car. My lease terms are sticky and do not allow a dealership to buy out my lease, so my only chance to covert that equity into another car purchase is to buy the car so that I can trade it once the title is in my name.

I'm thinking I will buy it, then turn around and trade it effectively opening an auto loan to close it within a week or two when I trade and open another one on whatever I buy.

Will having an auto loan that lasts a few weeks just to close that one and open another one impact my credit more than just financing one loan? If it does I will probably just abandon the equity and turn in the lease.

Would this be like opening a credit card account to close it right away and open another (which I know is a bad move)?

Thanks for your assistance!"
CRedit,"So I guess this is where I give my background. I’m 20, moved to college station from a very small town 2 days ago with my fiancée and 4 year old son, and neither of us have credit cards. We’re also debt free. My parents helped both of us start on building good credit, got our vehicles paid off in a timely manner. I opened a Varo savings account in planning ahead (trying to get 6 mos. of living expenses saved up soon.) I guess my question would be where to begin our journey? What’s a good starter card? How do we credit card churn? Is it effective? How easy is it for things to go sideways when churning? What long term goals should we work towards? So many questions! Also, I’m about to get my associate’s this semester, if that’s helpful at all. We just need a bit of direction, thanks all in advance!!"
CRedit,"Hello all!

New to this sub but really nice to see a lot of good dialogue here.

I have been working to repair my credit the last 5 years and have been spotless since then but still have about 2 years left of a defaulted student loan that was resold and eventually eventually paid off in full.  Unfortunately it did not go through the rehabilitation process because my income at my sales job went up a lot in a short period of time which disqualified me from the rehabilitation payment plan.

The good part is I am 100% debt free for several years now and pay of my credit cards 2-3x per month to keep utilization below 5%.

Without being too long winded, I am looking for advice as my wife and I are looking to buy a home in the next 6 to 18 months depending on market conditions and how fast we can keep saving.

I subscribed to MyFico recently and wasn't too surprised that my Fico8 scores were a bit lower than my Vatage scored from Credit Karma and Mint.

Fico 8 
699 equifax
678 transunion
705 experian

My wife is closer to 800 so that does helps our situation.

Because we are looking to start a family, we know we need to replace my old but paid off Toyota Corolla to get something more family friendly.

We aren't driving much because of COVID so I dont want to buy a car now, but I'm concerned about waiting too long and it negatively impacting my credit when we go to get a mortage.

Does it make sense to get the car sooner so that we have 6-8 months of good payments and a new payment type on my credit if we are thinking of getting a house next year, or do we wait as long as possible on the car hoping we have a house before a baby and thus needing the new car?

Thanks in advance for any input."
CRedit,"Basic question for those folks who have had car loans with an ACH debit for payments that have been paid off:

**Is the last payment--the payoff payment--usually processed automatically just like the rest of your payments have been?**

Background for question (bit of a long story):

We recently came to the end of the loan term on a car financed with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. We've had an ACH payment order set up with the lender since the loan inception, with a bank account that we no longer use for anything else. An automatic deposit from a paycheck went to that account to cover that one payment to NMAC, and we don't look at that bank account much. The NMAC account was set for paperless statements, but the email address connected to the NMAC account was no longer accessible.

I happened to look at our credit score (that we've spent years repairing after a foreclosure and bankruptcy many years ago, and not so great spending habits more recently) in early May, only to see that our 800+ FICO 3 score (from Experian) was down to 700-something (and now it's even lower, at 672). I was shocked, and when I looked at the credit reports, dismayed to realize that the last payment to NMAC didn't get made, and that the account was 90 days past due. The story from NMAC is that the last payment doesn't get made automatically, even if you have an ACH payment set up.

That's not how it's ever worked for us with auto loans in the past, though all of our other auto loans have been through Pentagon Federal Credit Union. PFCU just takes the last payment, and sends a nice letter saying thank you, and then forwards the title, so this was completely unexpected with NMAC.

This is all our own fault (paperless statements, bad email address, not keeping tabs on that bank account, etc.) but I'm just wondering if this is normal lender behavior. Knowing the answer might help when I go to ask for a goodwill change to our reports, or attach an explanation statement if the goodwill change never happens.

Thanks for any insight!"
CRedit,"Howdy! 

I have been lurking on this sub for a long time and really appreciate everyone who contributes here. It has helped shape my thinking financially for the better along with a few other subs over the past 2-3 years.

I have been actively working on improving my credit the last 5 months and it’s working, it’s becoming quite fun to see the score rise. 

I’m now moving onto tackling the blemishes on my credit report and one in particular I’m looking for advice with is below. 

It’s an old Wells Fargo “College Credit Card” I received when I was in school and did well with it but once I got into a little bit of a financial tight squeeze, I completely neglected it. Stupid but it is what it is and I’m looking correct it now. 

I just pulled my credit report this morning to start this process and find out what I need to address — here’s what it says under the Wells Fargo Credit Card entry... 

Potentially Negative 

Account Name: WF CRD SVC
Account Type: Credit Card 
Date Opened: 12/31/2008

Status: Account charged off. $500 written off. $500 past due as of July 2020. 

Status Updated: July 14, 2020

Balance: $500
Credit Limit: $700
Highest Balance: $925

On Record Until: Feb 2021


Questions:

1. Does it still look like Wells Fargo is holding the debt? Or was it sold to a collection agency?

2. The status is confusing to me. Can you help decipher that, can it be charged off, written off and still have a past due balance at the same time? 

3. On record until Feb 2021, does that mean it would fall of then? 

4. If Wells Fargo still holds the debt, what are the odds I could pay it off and reopen the account? Is it likely they would do that and would it be beneficial to my credit score more so then letting it fall off or just paying it off? 

5. Would love any info on maybe other angles or general thoughts on my situation I haven’t mentioned. 

Thank you for your help and if I left out any information that will help, please let me know."
CRedit,"I want to buy a new car after 11 years so I decided to pay off my debts.I Paid down 3 accounts out of 4. Right now  on credit karma only one account is showed being payed off and my score dropped 12 points for bringing down my account balance from 40%  usage (fair) down to 1% excellent. I love how I went down to ""excellent"" range and they tank my credit. I still have 2 more accounts so I may lose a total of 36 points for lowering my balance. This post is mostly a rant because my car is doing real bad and fixing it would exceed the cars value by a lot.

CRedit,"For the past 3 1/2 years I have been the primary provider in my relationship while my fiancé had delt with some mental health issues. We have been working on slowly improving his credit the last year and a half by paying more down on his vehicle and having him as an authorized user on my credit cards. Now that he is ready to start working and has recently landed a job, we took a more in depth look at his credit reports. Experian and transunion scores are almost in the 700s and have no bad marks besides the 2,000 debt left over from his vehicle. The Equifax report however, has a charge off from 2018 on an account his mom and him had been on together. We obviously would like to pay it off for moral reasons and clearing his conscience, but due to the pandemic we don’t have that money yet. If they haven’t contacted him in the two years, will they garnish his wages from his paychecks or start to pursue legal action now? What would be the best way for him to handle this?"
CRedit,"Hi All, apologies if this is the wrong forum - long time lurker and haven’t really posted anything...

Long story short, I’m in the process or repairing my credit score which was negatively impacted by delinquencies on student loans. I graduated college in 2007 and quickly ran into trouble with loan payments when the economy collapsed towards the end of 2008 and was left with low paying jobs while living in NYC. I had several late payments/delinquencies that I’m looking to get cleaned up. 

I was very generously gifted $ to pay off the loan in full recently. Now that the loan paid off, what options to I have, if any, to have those delinquencies removed from my report?

Is this a case where a Goodwill Letter for late payment removal might work?

Thanks in advance!

CRedit,"I recently visited a car dealership to lease a new car.  I leased the vehicle and on my latest credit report, I noticed two inquiries.  One is from the leading company (Honda) and the other from thee actual dealership.  Should I dispute the inquire from the local dealership? It was unnecessary in my opinion for the dealer to make a credit inquiry if they know I was going to lease.  Between the two inquiries and the new loan, my score dropped 25 points."
CRedit,Like the title says. I'm not sure how this happened. I was hospitalized in and off for a couple months for chronic kidney stones and surgery. Debt got bad but I've been paying my 2 remaining cards on time and in full for the life of the cards. 1 is about 10 years old and the 2nd is 4 or 5 years old.

I would love to have it paid off in some capacity soon or pay it and have it removed. I've read the wiki, but I have a few questions from others who know much more than me:

CRedit,"So I want to apply for my first credit card. My family is religious against having credit and debt, but I see through that and I know that I need to start building my own credit.

I want to avoid any angry arguments with them if they see any bills from banks or obvious credit lenders, so I want to apply for the card at my place of work (retail). I often shop here for little things here and there so paying it back wouldn’t be a challenge.

My question is, if I don’t have any credit history, do I have anything to lose if I apply and don’t get approved? Since there is no history for an inquiry to hit?"
CRedit,Hey all I just got my first statement from discover and Experian showed my score dropped from 714 to 698. I paid my balance to zero! I was shocked and now I’m just upset because I’ve worked so hard. Is there a reason? Info to add my due date is the 14th every month and it closes 5 days after. It’s a discover student it cash back card.
CRedit,In my recent experience with settling old debt it’s best to just pay in full. One account I settled for 50% off. I paid it and noticed there was a bunch of other things to do to get it updated. The one small debt I paid in full and it was automatically removed. The debt that I settled had a 5 point increase while the paid in full had a 20 point increase. This might be common knowledge to most but I just wanted to share my personal experience.
CRedit,So I got a notice from credit karma about an inquiry. Not shopping for a loan or card. I dispute it online with Equifax as they are the only agency reporting it. It's from Citibank. Equifax resolution says because inquiries are matter of facts it has to be manually disputed with Citi. This is ridiculous.
CRedit,"I have a medical bill that never got ran through insurance by the doctor's office (or so I thought). I disputed the amount twice and never heard back again. This month I received a notice about the unpaid medical bill being placed with a debt collection agency. This amount looks less than before I disputed, but I never received the updated bill. The notice from the debt collection agency looks extremely similar to the format of the statement/bill from the doctor's office and it shows that I can pay the balance by check written to EITHER the doctor's office or the collection agency.

Does this mean the doctor's office is likely just enlisting the help of the collection agency to help them collect the debt and not that the debt has already been sold? I am trying to understand if I will see this show up negatively on my credit report if I pay in full immediately and settle directly with the original creditor (the doctor's office)?

The ""service"" date was in 11/2019 and this collections notice is written as of 7/31/2020 and so far I have not seen any collections notices show up on my credit reports."

CRedit,"So I'm FINALLY looking to repair my credit (only took me to my mid-30s). I got my credit report and it's ugly. 503 score, and a LOT of closed student loan accounts.

EDIT 2: I just got another report from transunion, and their reports include an estimated date of removal, which is 12/2021 for most of them. So it seems like if I just keep ignoring them they will disappear from my credit in a little over a year....I think?"

my first credit score report card was about a 700, and within 6 months or so got to 740, but it feels like it’s been there for almost 2 years now. it goes up and down, but stays around 730-750. 

my student loans are in my name but funded by my parents, fafsa, and now a scholarship, but i don’t think they’ve been paid on yet. i just opened a second credit card as well. how can i make it go up to 800?"
CRedit,"Like the title says. I have been working on my credit for quite some time and finally broke over the 650 mark. In order to keep on climbing I have one more thing to pay off. It's an old charged off CC from 2013.  The balance is $462. I was able to remove it from TransUnion. Experian report states it will fall off next month. Here is where things get infuriating.

I filed a dispute for removal with Equifax in beggining of July. It came back at the beggining of August that the account was correct. Unlike Experian the report does not state when it is designated to fall off.  I called Equifax support and they told me it will be there until 2023. I asked them how is that possible since the limitation period for my state is 6 years. And it has been over 7 years that I have touched that account.  She explained that the agreement they have with First Premier is to have it there for 10 years..  

Even on their website it says that most negative information stays on for 7 years. And the only thing that stays on for 10 is closed accounts that are paid as agreed. 

Can anyways assist with the next steps?"
CRedit,"I have a 580 credit score right now, I’ve been trying to do something about it for years. One thing has led to another and have yet to still do anything. I have a vehicle repossession of about $6000 and a total collections debt of about $4200 is there anything I can do in regards to my vehicle repossession? I want to settle, but I’ve no idea what the best way to go about it is. Any tips and advice is welcomed and appreciated. Thanks!"
CRedit,"Got a text from ERC about collecting for debt yesterday. Called and it’s for a Charter Spectrum account that I forgot to return equipment for. Paid immediately over the phone. Called back to ask representative if it would show up on my credit score, and she said that the it wasn’t set to report until October. She said since I’ve paid it completely off before that reporting deadline that it would not be reported to any credit bureau. Is this correct? The collection doesn’t immediately e
Report? Just want to make sure I have screwed myself over for the next 7 years for forgetting this one thing."
CRedit,"I just got my first secured card $200 as my first line of credit. and with such a low amount it is very easy to get high utilization im sure. ive seen many different responses on this so im just asking to make sure im right. 

Lets say i use $150 of that $200 credit line if i pay it down to like $10 a day before the billing date will my utilization just be that $10 of the $200?"
CRedit,"So Im planning to get an Investment property in the next year but I just applied for my first credit card last week, How long would it usually take to get to a 700 score with no late payments or anything?"
CRedit,"Just went through pre-approval and bank let us know wife has 680 FICO 2.0 score which puts us at the full 1% for PMI. We just got married and had put stuff on CC but we paid it off in full the day after the bank ran the report.

Also, she had 4 student loan accounts that had missed payments right out of school in 2016 because the mail was messed up and a miscommunication between her parents. Hasn’t missed a payment since.

Her credit utilization was high but getting that down to 2%-5% now. I guess I’m wondering if there’s anything we can do to improve her score in the next 30-45 days? Also, any appeal I can do on the missed payments that were then paid in full back in 2016?

My 2.0 score was 796 but my understanding is they base it off the lowest score. Any tips would be much appreciated. Happy Friday all!"
CRedit,"Unfortunately, I waited until I was 23 to apply to a credit card and build credit. I had tried applying maybe three times to Capital One and Credit Union but they both regretted me. Discover had sent me an offer for a Discover Chrome Student credit card, was approved and finally received my first credit card. I currently have two cards, the other one is also a Student credit card. I didn’t have to put down a down payment for either card which is why I got them. I’m also in community college receiving FAFSA so everything is paid through aid so no loans and I live at home. I have a car, but it was bought from a family friend for cheap. My FICO score is sadly at 8. I just started in February so it’s basically nothing yet. I mainly use my credit card to pay my phone bill, sometimes food and clothing. I’m not in a position to buy a car during COVID and major buys, but I just want to know if there’s other options. What are other ways to build fast credit or just at a higher rate than where I can now?"
CRedit,"I have one late payment from an auto loan from years ago and just now discovered I could use a Goodwill letter to maybe convince someone to remove it. I've researched everything here and other places and I have all my ducks in a row but can't seem to find the email to anyone high enough to matter. It's a local credit union named Veridian in Waterloo, Iowa. 

If anyone can find and point me in the direction of their email list or can tell me another way to get this letter to who needs to see it I would be very grateful. 

Also, I considered just mailing it addressed to the new CEO but with the postal service being unreliable these days I don't know if that's a good idea?"
CRedit,"Many people are misinformed and sharing advice all the time that there are only 3 credit bureaus.  In fact there are many, many more.  Some do double duty as debt collectors, some focus on certain niches, some love to fly under the radar but are used extensively in certain markets, etc...

**They all impact each and every one of us.**

Some may be called a consumer reporting agency vs credit reporting agency, but they are essentially the same thing.  They report much of the same information and in many cases much more than the big 3.  Many of them maintain separate credit scoring models as well.

Updated the sidebar to include four of the more common ones: Innovis, SageStream, ChexSystems, and PRBC.  There are many, many more however.  Also noteworthy is [LexisNexis](https://consumer.risk.lexisnexis.com/consumer).

Here are some things to know about these other bureaus:

1. You think dealing with the big 3 is a pain? You haven't seen anything yet.  It is extremely frustrating dealing with these other bureaus.  Especially for freezes (they hate that, because that means less money for them).  Expect to do everything by mail, multiple times, with a lot of sorry we can't validate your identity excuses.
2. Some of them get **WAY** more data than you realize.  Go pull your LexisNexis reports and be surprised what they have on you that is not directly related to credit but used for all sorts of modeling and marketing.
3. The love the fact everyone ignores them or don't even know they exist.  You should manage them as much if not even more closely than the big 3.
4. Many of their reports / scores can dramatically impact things such as insurance rates in some states so ignoring them can cost you a lot of money you didn't realize.  They are used in banking, background checks, insurance, traditional credit, rental checks and other areas.
5. Their scoring systems are not nearly as well known and can behave dramatically differently from FICO / Vantage.  Have a 750+ FICO / Vantage score? Well your score from one of these might be mid 400s and with very little information around on how to improve it.
6. They all fall under the same FRCA regulation so your rights with them are the same with the big 3. You have the right to ensure they have correct information and the right to dispute it (be prepared though, see #1).
7. There are many ""sub"" reports such as a CLUE report from LexisNexis which is used for accident claims.  Errors on these can cost you significant amount of money and you need to monitor them as well.

When we get some time we will put a more exhaustive list in the Wiki as putting it on the sidebar would be a bit much."
CRedit,"I’m 18 and I have had a credit card with Discover for almost a month. I have a $500 balance with a pretty high APR. Whenever I put anything on my card (small purchases such as gas, fast food, etc.) I pay it off as soon as I can (usually 1-3 days after I make the purchase). Is this smart for someone who wants to build credit? Or should I let my balance on my card get higher and then pay it off? Or should I only make one payment a month? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: Solved, thank you all for the helpful information!!"
CRedit,"My credit score dropped over 150 points since this pandemic started.  No fault to my own, my unemployment check didn't come in for almost 5 months, leaving my card maxed.  I paid the minimum payment on time every month and never missed a single one.  Is there a way to hire a lawyer or anyway to get it bumped back up, or am I just going to have to eat the credit score drop?
 
Thanks for the help!"
CRedit,"So my husband and I have been working very hard to rebuild our credit this year in hopes of buying a house next spring. We thought everything was going good, however this week we tried buying a truck (mostly to get me on the lease to help my score out) and even though according to his FICO (fico 8 from Discover) and credit karma he’s at 650-710 on his credit scores, wherever they pulled from showed him at a mid-500 score! 

We passed on the truck because it’s not a necessity right now, but now I’m curious and worried, how will we ever know when our credit is finally good enough to buy a house? Will we keep saving and saving and working on our credit scores for years to finally be ready then get our dreams dashed because some random score from god knows where shows us at 500 instead of 700? It’s so frustrating! 

I guess my question is where do we actually need to be looking to know when our credit is finally in that sweet spot allowing us to buy?"
CRedit,"I just reviewed my credit report from all 3 credit bureaus today and saw I have a balance of $778 on a Wells Fargo credit card and marked as charged off. It was opened 01/2016 and is stated to be removed 03/2023.  I'm just trying to improve my credit.

Should I pay it and if i do will it help my credit ? Will it disappear in 2023 even if i don't pay it ?

not sure what to do here.

also i read something online about disputing it... will that help? no it hasn't been sold to a collector.

thanks in advance."
CRedit,"I currently drive a car that I owe $ 9400 on...    The old truck that I've been using to tow my trailers and do my farm work with has catastrophically failed.   I have decided to trade in my car which is worth about $6000 according to the dealer, And buy a newer truck.

My question is, do I pay my car loan down with the $3000 I have in order to reduce the amount of negative equity, or do I just use the 3000 as a down payment?"
CRedit,If so any tips ? I’m currently at 450 I have a $200 secured credit line &amp; I have one account that’s not paid off. I’m almost finished with paying it off.
CRedit,"Hello everybody. I am looking for a list of 3rd party credit card issuers like Card Assets, LLC, Elan financial, TCM BANK/common sense lenders and First Bank Card/ First National Bank of Omaha.  These companies handle the credit card application process and ongoing customer service for other banks.Are you aware of any other such companies?"
CRedit,"Hello. Hoping for some advice for the best route for cleaning up the financial mess I've made.

Hopefully you're up for a little back story:
6 years ago I was in a very toxic relationship with a heroin addict. I fell down the rabbit hole with him and my life basically bottomed out. Although I've since ditched the deadbeat and have been clean for almost 4 years now, I am still paying for some poor financial decisions I made while with him. We opened some credit cards (in my name of course 🤦‍♀️) and in 2016 everything fell apart. We broke up, I lost my job and could no longer pay rent on my apartment. He went to rehab paid for by the state, meanwhile I had to move back in with my dad and detox cold turkey. Apparently I had too much money to qualify for any state assistance, funny how that works out. Not that I believe in drug rehab anyway but I digress... 

Fast forward to today and I'm so very blessed to finally be in a healthy relationship with a man I love and trust and who is responsible. I'd like to marry him someday but I would never want to muddy his name with my poor credit. This man loves me and I really don't wanna screw it up... In fact, he bought us a house and even put my name on the title. Don't worry, he knows ALL the skeletons in my closet! 

Some important points:

-I lost my job not even a month after we moved in due to stupid covid :( My income is a little bit of unemployment I get as well as selling on Ebay (which I'd like to keep on the low) 

-My credit score is currently 630-640 (some bot just told me to edit this to where I am getting my FICO. I have Credit Karma and was able to print my reports from Transunion, Equifax and Experian I thought these were the 3 main bureaus? anyway... ) I had to claim bankruptcy after 2008's lovely fiasco and it's due to fall off my credit next month.  

-I'm currently being sued by Midland Funding for a measly $882. This prompted me to get my credit report and finally take a look at the full extent of the damage. 

-Right now I see 6 accounts that are charged off, totaling just over 15K. So far, only 2 of those accounts are in collections, both debts that Midland bought (shysters!)

I also have some current debt which reflects well on my reports since I've tried very hard to learn better financial hygiene lol I owe:

$4700 to Santander for my car loan (got it at a very low interest rate of 2% before I wrecked my good standing)

$1700 on a credit union Visa that's probably around 14%

$2000 to my uncle for basically paying all the fees to bail my dumb ass out of a drug induced DWI.. try driving down the freeway when you're ASLEEP... I can't believe I'm even alive sometimes.. 

$1800 on a Home Depot card (it's my bfs account, he just put me as an authorized user to try and help me rebuild my credit 

I half heartedly started to repair (or at least prevent further damages) to my credit report about 2 years ago which included paying for 2 beaten up apartments I had while with the above loser. (Honestly I was the loser for ever allowing someone to f#$% up my life so royally) Oddly enough I don't see that those were ever even reported on my credit 🤔 So much for trying to be responsible 

So in total that's over 20 grand. It has been a long and sometimes very stressful climb out of that deep dark hole... and I'm still just trying to make things right. 

On a good note, I've managed to save up $7600 which is the most I've ever saved. I am wondering what the best use of this money would be. Since the pandemic I've had a lot of time on my hands so bought some books on finance and personal improvements. I wanted to siphon off this $ for a little bit while I figure out my next career move because I was really unhappy at my last job... in fact, work induced stress is a huge trigger for me to use, it's why I tried heroin in the first place. I really don't want to get another soul killing corporate gig... I was SO looking forward to getting my ducks in a row and possibly even investing so I could make my money grow and have something to fall back on later in life. I have major depression with 2 suicide attempts under my belt which I am not proud of but the thought of going back to corporate america drudgery makes me wish I WAS dead. 

I'm sorry for the freaking life story novel here jesus.... just trying to paint a picture of what life looks like for me right now.  

I'd really rather avoid another BK seeing as how freaking HARD I've been trying to finally get it together in life and doing that would be like flushing it all down the toilet. I realize that even though some of the charged off accounts aren't currently in collections, it doesn't mean they won't be in the future. With that said, it's been about 4 years since they saw a pmt from me and my states statute of limitations is 6.. so maybe they could fall off on their own? 

I really do want to take responsibility but I'm losing a lot of sleep and it's all just so emotionally draining... 

As for the lawsuit, I answered the complaint so as to not get a default judgment. I know the burden of proof lies with Midland so I'm basically forcing their hand and asking them to validate the debt. They sent me a bunch of old statements. I'm not trying to say the debt isn't mine but there is no signature and IF they sent me a letter of intent to sue I didn't get it. Isnt that in itself a violation?? I think it is SO corrupt that these junk debt buyers get away with what they do.. SO many people are suffering because they are ethically bankrupt.  

Yes, I COULD pay it from my savings BUT I'm worried that if I make a large pmt on ANYTHING right now it will bite me later. Will other lawsuits pop up if any of the other creditors see if I settle with Midland?? I am aware that any debt over $600 is considered a gain and will be taxed so I'm thinking of offering $300 to try and put a stop to this... but what if they refuse and try and seize my bank account? 

I guess my final question is, what should I do with my 7K? Take it out?? I'm growing quite distrustful in ANY financial institution anyway. My bf said he would hold my money for me if I want.. 

Maybe I should just pay my car off? Or be proactive and just try to pay as much on old debt as I can? How do I even find out who owns the other charged off accounts?? I would like to prevent further lawsuits while I get my life figured out!! 

I'm so tired of feeling overwhelmed. It's like 2 steps forward and 10 back... this has been a LONG 4 years to try and make things ""right"". Bleh just throw me in debtors prison and get it over with 🙄

Well.... If you've read this far, THANK YOU for your precious time.  Any advice or just words of encouragement would be very appreciated. Feeling pretty disillusioned 😵"
CRedit,I just received my student credit card in the mail today. I think it has about a 500 dollar limit. I’ve heard different advice from my parents and mentors. Should I leave a small balance on the card and pay it off or pay the balance completely off every month? The goal is to slowly build my credit. My credit score is around 600 with student loans. I hope that makes sense.
CRedit,"Wife and I are expecting twin boys within the next two months provided all continues as planned.. Having struggled immensely with credit at a young age and into my later twenties, (no ones fault but my own irresponsibility and both wife and I are very solid now) I'd like to do everything I can to at least help build them a solid foundation to become ""adults"" more easily and quickly in their early twenties. Yes, we plan to educate them as completely as possible about financial responsibility and credit, and ultimately if they mess it up then at least we have done all that we could.

What are some options here for early credit establishment? I guess I'm looking for as early an establishment as possible here, hence the title."
CRedit,"I’m very new to Credit cards. I’m trying to raise my credit and was offered a 5,000 “upgrade card” today. I understand that this is not a typical credit card. 

I’m wondering if it is a wise choice just to accept the offer to raise my credit score. I currently do not have any intention of using the card as I do not need the credit. I’m just looking to raise my score which is currently at a 639/660 FICO. Any help would be appreciated!"
CRedit,"Hi- I recently opened a new card, and was wondering how long before it would show when other lenders pull my report on a credit report... many thanks!"
CRedit,I have 3 credit cards all paid off except one I am using. I am about to pay my car off this month. I hit a down time and my on time payment has reach 96% which were car payments. I need to increase my score 20 points in two years. I'm curious about two things. If I make multiple payments per month on my one card does each payment count as on time? Example I owe. 100$ and do 25$ each week before closing date is that 4 on time payments? Secondly if thats not the case would it be in my best interest to utilize all three of my cards to make more on time payments on time or would that hurt me more?
CRedit,"Hi, I recently froze my Innovis credit online and never received the PIN in the mail. I was wondering, for anyone who has frozen with them in the past, does the letter with the PIN contain your SSN? At this point I'm pretty sure it got snatched in the mail and I'm hoping my SSN isn't in there. Thanks!"
CRedit,"Okay so here is my situation:

About 4/5 years ago I got myself into some debt. I have since worked hard to resolve all of it. I entered into a debt relief program (had I found this sub back then I would have done it all myself!!) And there is only one account left that isn't settled and I want to handle it the best way possible. I have the extra cash at the moment to handle that last account (enrolled in the debt program but have no negotiated the settlement yet) but I'm unsure how I go about this. 

Do I need to go through the debt relief program? Do I reach out to the credit card company directly? Do I need to find out which collection agency has it? And then once I figure out who has it, can I attempt to negotiate the final payoff? Or should I just go ahead and pay the amount and call it a day? 

I want to do what I can (if anything) to keep the charge off from my credit report (unsure if this is even possible) but more than anything I just want this all to be done. 

Ive seen this sub has a TON of information and everyone is so helpful so I figured I could start here since I don't know what I'm doing almost at all!"
CRedit,Hearing an seeing on other platforms about trade lines and how they can help give you a quick boost. Was wondering if anyone has any knowledge on this and how it can help with credit. Any down sides ?
CRedit,"Hey everyone. I ran my transunion credit report January of this year 2020. It shows I only have three active debts from creditors. I’m not sure if anything else has been added between January and now, but who knows? 

$590 - department store - estimated removal - January 2022

$6,120 - credit card - estimated removal - December 2022

$85 - doctors office - estimated removal - February 2024 

I was wondering if I should wait out the higher priced collections. I am trying to rebuild my credit. What should I do?"
CRedit,Are there any risks to using a service that reports your rent payments? Has anyone had success boosting your score with this?
CRedit,"Current credit score is 684 at equifax (per their paid service) and similar at Transunion (per CreditKarma). 

I currently have on my report 100% on time payment history (this might be temporary, something about how the student loan forebearance was done for Covid wiped all my missed payments and jumped my score 50+ points overnight), 16% utilization, 0 derogatory marks, credit age is 4 years 7 months, Total accounts is 18, hard inquiries is 1 (rental for a house) though they told me it wouldn't be a hard pull. 

&amp;#x200B;

Credit cards follow

Discover 1130/2400 47% utilization.

Citi 380/3000 13% utilization.

Capital One 117/1500 8% utilization.

Capital One 41/1000 4% utilization (authorized user)

Capital One 0/2750 0% utilization.

A few months ago utilization was 95% across the board. Covid has been good for business (awkwardly) so was able to pay them down with ease.

Student loans 73,k total balance on 2 loans.

One is 60k on 47k (have missed a lot of payments but not showing atm) 

Other is 14k on 12.5k.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a Kohls account that closed on Jan 31 (auto closed as I never used it, didn't expect them to do that). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still showing a collection on credit Karma (164) but Equifax that updated more recently is showing deleted and it jumped my score 20 points.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point what I am hoping to do is either increase my credit card limits (not sure if any of the above banks have a good system for me to do so or are likely to approve?) or open better cards while the late payments are temporarily ""hidden"" from scoring models. Curious what cards I might qualify for with that credit score and current usages and anything I can tweak to further improve my score even if only temporarily. Mostly looking for cashback cards but good travel cards might be interesting if they are easier to qualify for (would like to travel, just never have really). I make decent money these days through my business and Christmas is coming so access to capital becomes important during that time. Any suggestions?"
CRedit,"Hello, years ago (2017) I used to have an account with an ISP company. Service was horrible and spotty. I stopped paying because for 6 months I never had internet service yet the bills never stopped coming. Eventually I just forgot about it. The letters stopped coming in. Im building my credit little by little. Its in decent shape. But in one of the Credit Bureaus (650) this account is being reported on. While checking my credit I noticed that the charge off was never reported from 6/17 all the way to 6/19. All of a sudden on 7/19 they started reporting a C/O on my account and its still being reported on  to this day. Last time was on 7/2020. It skipped months 12/19 and 6/20. Can they do this? I feel like its wrong and I should be able to fight it based on this alone. I havent touched it for fear of waking the monster. At this point I refuse to acknowledge this debt. I havent heard or talked to this company since 2017. What are my options here?"
CRedit,"I stupidly cosigned a $5,000 private student loan a few years ago for my boyfriend at the time. We’ve since broke up. He was abusive, and we haven’t been in touch for about two years now. He recently stopped paying and allowed the account to become 60 days past due. I receive monthly statements via email, but since he’s been paying it, I don’t even open them. They just reported the past due payment to the credit bureaus and my FICO score dropped 65 points, from 730 to 665. I immediately paid the past due balance, but wtf! Is there ANY way I can get the 60 day late payment off my credit report?? I’m preparing to buy a house but it’s going to be impossible with such a huge drop in my score. I called the loan servicer but they pretty much told me I was shit out of luck."
CRedit,I don’t know what company to go to/ what any of this means and I don’t like taking risks with money unless I know what risk I’m taking
CRedit,"Long story short, my credit got recked (marital separation, plus some other stuff). My score (using Equifax**)** dropped to 527 in February of this year when I started repairing it. I've gotten a lot of bad debt off of my report (now $8k vs $26k before - most of which not ""mine,"" per se). I have also gotten a few bad credit credit cards and a secured card (total of 4 cards) and am doing Self's loan thing. My score is now 593. This represents a 66 point rise in 6 months, or 11 points per month. This seems really swift. Can I expect this to continue? If so, a year from now, is it reasonable to expect a 720 score, or will this slow? What else can I do to make this go up. I'd really like to get this to to 720+ ASAP. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!!"
CRedit,"Hi Everyone,

I'm looking to apply for a mortgage sometime in mid 2021 and I want to have the highest FICO score possible. I'm interested in applying for a 3rd credit card, so I can can increase my total number of accounts and credit age. I applied for my 2nd credit card about 7 months ago. Currently, my FICO score is 702 and has been dropping a bit the past 2 months. 

I think this might be because I've paid off two of my student loans, but I'm not certain. I wanted to get some opinions on if getting a credit card would be wise to combat the closing of my student loan accounts. I've heard having at least 3 revolving forms of credit is ideal for your FICO score. However, given the time frame, I don't want to have a hard inquiry affecting my FICO and my chances for approval. 

Please let me know your thoughts, thank you."
CRedit,"I'm not quite sure when to pay on my credit card because it says $0 due but I have a balance.  Even though there is nothing due should I still pay off my balance before the due date, or do I wait for the c.c. company to bill me an amount then pay off the balance?"
CRedit,"I just got a letter in the mail saying another company forwarded my account to them and if i don't reply in 30 days they'll assume it's true and put it on my credit again. 
Can they do that? 
I dont understand why they're just now sending me something about it. Years and years later"
CRedit,"I don't have any credit cards,  not am I making any payments that would contribute to building my credit. Does anybody know what a -1 credit score means?"
CRedit,"Okay, I applied for the amazon prime rewards card and Chase didn't accept me and they said they were gonna send a letter to know if I was gonna get accepted or not and after 2 days I got another hard pull from JP Morgan but now in another credit bureau... why?!"
CRedit,"Hi I’m looking at a house that we are buying for $625k. To keep it a conventional loan and lower % down we are maxing the loan at $510,400 and putting the rest as cash. 

Our lender said due to our credit (626 and 646) our rate is 4.3% but we have the option of paying $5k to get the rate down to 3.8%.

My question is: does the $5,000 go towards paying down the mortgage or is that a “fee” for a lower rate? I asked him as well but I’m curious if this is normal or if you have advice?"
CRedit,"Hi there,

In July I finally got the Discover IT secured card with $800 limit.  

I recently paid off a 742$ collection from LVNV funding for a credit one card I defaulted on and it should be removed in the next month or so.  Hoping that should raise my score decently since LVNV reported every month so there is unpaid collection entries for the past like 7-8months since they bought it.

On a whim I tried the capital one prequalify link and saw I now pre-qualify for the unsecured platinum card as well as the quicksilver one card.  Is it worth applying for one of them to add to my available credit limit (which is now $1401...plus another $500 from an AU account)?  I also forgot to say I’m like 4 months into a $150/month self loan.  I still have one more (semi-recent) derogatory from ATT collection from like 3-4 years ago and also waiting for my defaulted federal student loans of 14k and 2k to rehab and removed from report.  Covid has put a hold on that since I only had 2 payments withdrawn of the 10 or so I needed before Covid stopped all student loan payments.

Is it worth applying for one of these cards right now?  I know capital one doesn’t upgrade secured cards, besides adding to the limit, so I was assuming I’d have to close the secured card out one day to receive my $200 back.  Would it be smart to just apply for the unsecured version now that way when I go to close the secured version it doesn’t hit the average age as bad?  I wasn’t planning on closing the card anytime soon, but maybe in like a year or two when my credit score is in the good territory.  Then I calculated if I got the quicksilver one card, with the 39$ annual fee I’d need to spend like $217 a month to break even.  While this is under my normal spending a month it would take away from the relationship I’m trying to build with discover right now.  I’d like to get that upgraded and refund of my $800 within the minimum 8month timeframe, and I fear if I switched over to mostly using the new quicksilver one card it may not happen as quickly."
CRedit,"I recently had a problem with my creditor report due to an outstanding collections account. I followed some of the advice on Reddit and decided to send dispute letters via certified mail to the three credit bureaus. After a few weeks, I received my first response from Equifax stating that the debt had been verified, and that it would be kept on my credit report going further. Instead of waiting for the other two credit bureaus to respond to the disputes, I went on to send a “Pay to Delete” letter to the collection agency. At this point, I felt like all three credit bureaus would all say the same thing and I didn’t want to waste anymore time. My goal was to purchase my first home within the following months. However, today I received a letter from Experian indicating that they deleted the collections account from my credit report. I checked all three of more scores from the credit bureau and I saw my credit score jumped 100 points. Now, I am worried that the collections account will somehow be put back or restored onto my credit report because I sent out the “Pay to Delete” letter. I did specify in the letter to the collections agency that the “Pay to Delete” letter was not an acceptance of the debit, nor was it a promise to pay. Is it possible that the collections account will be restored to my credit report?"
CRedit,"I discovered that I have a collection showing on my credit report when I thought I had paid everything off about two years ago. When I reached agreements previously I thought I was clear that I wanted to reach a settlement but only if negative remarks were removed from my credit report. I was often told verbally that this would happen. I knew I should be getting this in writing at the time, but I was in a hurry to get things paid off. All my old accounts still show with negative remarks, but they show as settled.
I want to handle this last collections item correctly. What language should I use to indicate I want to basically pay for a deletion. I have read that this is possible, but I have screwed it up in the past. Can I ask for a written email confirmation of the agreement before I make a payment? I will be doing a lump sum settlement for a few hundred bucks. 
I apologize if I sound totally uniformed here, that’s why I’m looking for more info about what might be possible. This account is about 4.5 years old, but I need to handle it before it falls off after 7 to raise my credit score as much as I can.
If there is a better way to approach this, please share your thoughts."
CRedit,"Back in May I had a fraudulant credit card opened and maxed out in my name. I called Credit One and had to jump hoops to talk to someone in the fraud department. I eventually got in touch with some one, explained the problem and was told the account was opened in an unknown location and it was closed but stayed on my credit report. Few days ago i got a notification on my Captial One app that my account is now delinquent and I need to pay. Called Credit One again and now my address matches with the one applied but its a different phone number. I never applied for credit one and the only card i have is a capital one walmart card. My father has a credit one card however, are names are the same but obviously different SS numbers. I tried to login on the credit one app in May with his card number and my SS but it wouldn't work. I never got a credit one card in my mail, i never applied for one in the first place. What do I do next?"
CRedit,"When I was in high school my Dad open a joint bank account with me so I can pay for metro cards and lunch. 

I think I used it like once as a freshman then never again. 

Fast Forward 15 years later and he's been using this account as his primary account. 

I completely forgot about this account until I went to visit and noticed his statement has both our names. 

I don't care the account is in good standing, but I'm at the point in my loan where I need to submit my bank information to verify I have enough money to close. 

His retirement and SS benefits are deposited into this account. Will that be used to my benefit? Against me ? It's not my income at all nor do I need it for closing.

CRedit,"i need some advice.  i received a pre-approved loan from american web loan.  my credit score is currently sitting at 625- 635 thru the 3 bureaus.  FICO scores. the loan amount is for 1,000 dollars.  i have 7 cc with the largest balance being about 300 with the total for all 7 cards being 800.  i dont need the loan but i was thinking i could get loan and pay it back and maybe that would boost my score.  i already have 3 hard inquiries over the last 2 years.  is it worth it to get the loan or just trash it"
CRedit,"Hi all, I have a student credit card with a limit of $1200 per month. I have heard that you do not want to go above 30% spent. However, my parents (who have really good credit scores) said it does not matter as long as I pay it off in full and on time. Which one is correct? I want to use my credit card to purchase stuff because of the reward points."
CRedit,How BAD does a voluntary repo show on your credit. I've been suckered into the worst loan ever. It was a desperation move at the time now all I want to do is give this car back. I am in Florida if anyone can help Thanks
CRedit,"Hello, I am an average millennial that has had trash credit (&lt;600) for several years due to medical bills that had to go unpaid. Recently, the oldest account aged off my credit report, causing it to go up 78 points! 😱 I have only 2 other accounts on my report, one being another medical account for ~$1000 and my student loan which I have paid religiously for the past 5 years because applying for loan forgiveness is my only feasible option. But I am also aware that I have some other medical bills (totaling ~$1000 as well)  that I need to pay down before they hit my credit, so my real question is what is my best plan of action? My not very knowledgeable thoughts are below:

1) Ignore the existing medical bill account on my report (age 3+ years) and focus on paying down my other medical bills, starting with the cheapest first and as I pay those off, begin making payments towards my largest one (~$600).

2) Focus on paying off the existing account with ERC first.

3) Consider credit consolidation. I know most folks warn against it, but I'm willing to pay a certain amount of markup for convenience if everything outside of my student loan could be consolidated into a single problem with an affordable payment plan.

Due to COVID, my fiance and I are both working from home and able to save much more than we ever have before due to cutting out transportation costs. I feel like now is the best possible time for me to focus on improving my credit.

We are looking into purchasing a car soon, and we are also planning to find a new place to rent next year, and the higher I can possibly get my credit before then will obviously help us out immensely. Any advice is greatly appreciated! 🙏"
CRedit,"I owe money to Amex and Chase for some maxed-out cards

Got a letter from American Express Global Collections offering to regain card membership status by paying off in full or settle for less 

Do any of these options help with my credit score at all?"
CRedit,"Hi all!

I'm really gunning for the Chase trifecta and wondering what to do next. I was approved for my first ever chase account, the CFU on 05/12. I soon after applied for the CF on 05/19 and 06/27 and was instantly denied for reasons of recent hard pulls and age of cards with Chase. By now, I've done $6300 in spending on my CFU.

I'm eager for my next card, should I wait a bit to increase my chances of approval with the CF? Or am I in a place where getting the Reserve is possible?

My details: My Vantage Credit score is 758. Average age: 2.5 years. Hard pulls in last month: 1 (I got the Amex Blue Cash), hard pulls in last 2 months: 3 (I applied for the CF twice). I have about 5% utilization, with about $23k in credit lines and 5k in student debt."
CRedit,"I recently received the money to pay of my car and student loans early. However after a bit of research I found out that doing so would negatively impact my credit.

If I paid both of my only debt left would be my mortgage and apparently having a single line of credit out can negatively impact your score, even it is because you proved that you can pay off other debts.

So I thought I'd out smart the system and prepaid and large portion of both my car and student loans so that they balance isn't $0 but my next payments aren't due for several years.

So my question, by keeping a small balance (interest will be pennies, aka not a concern if it accrues over a couple years) does this actually help maintain my credit better than having paid them off completely, since it would show a diversified lending portfolio?

Edit: not sure if this would play a factor but I'm 27 and my score is currently in the 810-820 range"
CRedit,"During a divorce that ran through 2016, there was a unpaid Verizon wireless account that I didn’t realize was in my name. The bill was 1100 roughly and in the bustle of everything that was going on I didn’t even realize it. Never hear about it, fast forward to this month and I get a hit on my credit saying it was sent to collections. That’s 4 years later, is there a time limit they have for this? Does the 7 year drop off start fresh every time it’s bought by another collection agency? Will paying it off now affect my credit the same if I paid it off  within the first two years? Thanks for any help you can give!"
CRedit,"Provided that in each scenario, less than 30% of the total available limit is being utilized and the balance is paid off monthly. would it be better to be reporting one credit card's charges, or three cards?"

CRedit,"Throwaway account because reasons...

5 years and a half ago, I financed a new car for 23k at 0%. I had some trouble with credit as a young adult, so I was both happy and surprised to be offered 0% financing! One thing I didn't expect is that I was also offered a 14k CC on top of it. Now, I know you'll never be offered credit when you actually need it, I thought ""why not?""... It was a Visa, I only had an MC at the time and the interest rate was really low, like 11.99%. 

Well, let's say the bank made up that 0% and then some. Next thing I knew, the balance started creeping up. I would make purchases and wouldn't pay it back right away. Before long, the old habit of not looking at my statements came back...

Forward to September 2018. My GF and I were trying for a baby and what do you know, the stick turned blue! Quite the life changer, that's for sure... So now, realizing the predicament I'm about to find myself in, I dare to look at my CC statements and boy, am I in for a rude awakening! Turns out I dug myself a 13k hole!!! Do I need to tell you I had a hard time sleeping at night? I would literally spend the night tossing and turning, thinking about how the hell I'd manage to get out of this... I swear, I would get in my car and all I'd hear on the radio was bankruptcy trustee ads.

Now, I was making around 60k at the time, still renting at 34, but I did have some extra money at the end of the month. So I started by paying the lowest balance one, which also had the highest interest rate. Debt snowball/avalanche combo, sweet! I was also paying the minimum on the second one, even throwing an extra 200-300$ here and there.

About a year later, I got a promotion at work, taking me to 70k. And just like that, more money to put towards debt! 

My son was born in June 2019 and we were very lucky to have been gifted a lot of baby stuff. Also, my GF was breastfeeding, so our baby's first year didn't cost us much really. Being Canadians, we are blessed with great maternity leave benefits + child benefits, so our financial situation was even better then before! On top of that, as new parents, we basically didn't have any social life anymore. Gone were the days of movie dates or going to the restaurant! Again, more money to put towards debt!

Now, things were going pretty well, then this little thing called COVID-19 hits. I have to say we were some of the lucky ones! See, I work in insurance, so I remained employed all this time, working from home! Still, I had over 7k left to pay, so a long way off regardless. At this point my first CC was down to 0, so all of my extra money goes to the other one.

Luckily, my yearly bonus came in just before COVID, so I put that towards the remaining CC balance. As much as I would have liked to treat myself to something nice, feeling hopeful about climbing out of debts felt like reward enough!

Funny thing about COVID is that it really made me frugal. I would think of buying something on Amazon or something, leave it in my cart and come back to it a few days later, thinking about how I don't really need it. Also, this lockdown thing meant no more visiting my family (gas, food, activities). So there you go, even more money to put towards debt!

These past 3 months, I really went all in and paid between 1 and 1,5k each month. I saw the balance drop really quickly, which has been insanely satisfying! 

And here I am now, with just under a little under 1k to go. Also, my car is almost finished paying, so I'm about to be completely debt-free! Best of all, now that I'm not going to be throwing all my extra money at CC debt, I'll start saving extra fast towards a downpayment for a house! It really is an amazing feeling, like a huge load has been taken off!

In case you're also wondering, my credit scores are also pretty decent, between 750 and 800. Those aren't FICO's because we Canadians can't get them. Only lenders can and they will tell you your score if you ask.

So here are my takeaways :

1- Limit your spending... 

I know, it goes without saying but I got into debt for a reason. I was spending carelessly without paying it back (more on that later).

2- Increase your income. 

I was lucky to get that promotion and the bonus. If you don't have such luck, find yourself a second job, but earning more really is the key and it made a HUGE difference for me!

3- Whatever you do, DON'T STICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND! 

Or if you do, wake up! Whoever said time heals all things clearly never got into CC debt! Check your statements monthly. Check your credit report monthly. Set-up payment reminders and alerts. I sleepwalked my way into debt, but paying it back took a lot of conscious efforts.

4- This one is optional, but still important IMO. Learn to use credit responsibly. 

It's ok to use your credit card for regular purchases. I've been using mine for online purchases and stuff, but I make sure to pay it back by the end of the month. Just like someone coming out of a diet will often put back the weight, you risk falling into the same traps if you don't learn new behaviors. I know a lot of people say you should cut your cards or freeze them in an ice block or something, but I think you're better off learning from your mistakes instead.

TDLR : I got 13k into CC debt. Paid it off in a little under 2 years, despite having a newborn baby and also COVID."
CRedit,"I’m kind of new here and I work in consumer lending so I’m not sure if this is common knowledge. In the US a lender is required to disclose the credit score they used whenever they run your credit. This is true for soft pulls as well. I use this to my advantage by using companies that initially only require a soft pull on their application or credit line increase request. The one I find most useful is for my mortgage credit scores. Personally, I use Amerisave and start the refinance application and stop after the Credit Score portion. It will allow you to download the credit disclosure which they will mail to the home address you inputted as well. Just know that various lenders require different amounts of information (mailing address, phone number, email, sometimes SSN) so do that part to your own comfort level. Some will attempt to contact you a lot and others won’t at all. I hope this is helpful to those who can’t pay for credit subscription services."
CRedit,"On 11/2018 I had a 530 FICO credit score. Today all my scores are over a 760. Of course there are some pretty obvious reasons as the old negatives were close to 7 years old when I began (and have since fallen off) so any new credit with responsibility since then immediately began pushing my score up. I was over a 700 before the old even fell off.

I used 2 secure credit cards and a retail installment loan place called Conn's so I had 3 different places reporting my progress. The 2 secured credit cards have since become unsecured (normal) credit cards. They were/ are a Citi Mastercard and a Discover card. I use my Citi for my gas only and my Discover card for EVERYTHING else I can. This amounts to around 20%-30% of my credit utilization rate though I pay the balance off in full several times a month to insure it is never too high at any given time. 

Anyways, as to my post title, the Discover card has a 1% cashback reward (on specified purchases that I regularly purchase anyways groceries, goods, etc). This only amounts to maybe $20-$30 a month cashback, but in paying my balance off in full, and never being charged interest in the process, I am able to apply my 1% cashback reward towards my principal balance thereby reducing the overall price (principal amount) of every single purchase I make every month. So while I am building and solidifying a solid credit score I am simultaneously using the same tools to reduce my overall monthly expenditure, thereby increasing my savings over and above my budget. These are purchases I would be making anyways even without my card, but in using my card I end up reducing the averaged price of everything I purchase with or without the card as I get money back over and above my monthly budget that I would not have created without the card.

This isn't some huge revelation, and likely many here already do it, but it is a good bit of advice for any who may not have known about it. Use money to create new money. Use tools to rebuild credit and save you money."
CRedit,"As an 18 and 19 yo with parents who knew nothing about money, I maxed out a few cards, never paid my bills, got it sent to debt collectors, ($7000) and got a lot in student loan debt ($22k). Now I’m 24 and have a 550 score via credit karma. Now that I have a stable job I’m working on paying off all of that debt (around $700-$800 a month is the most I can afford right now. I’m putting aside the $700ish a month until I have the full amount the debt is and then calling and asking if they’ll take less). I have no credit cards and my car loan has one payment on it which I’ll pay at the end of the month. I want on my credit that I’m making my payments on time, but since my car loan is almost over, I’m worried about that. I was looking into secured cards through my credit union and through capital one (capital one prequalified  me for an unsecured one, but I’m afraid they’ll do a hard pull and then eventually deny me because of my income to debt ratio).

CRedit,"Hey all. Recently was called by Coastal Professionals, Inc. I have an unpaid debt from a university and was just notified. I never received anything in the mail, email, or phone from the University. I left school mid semester and owe some. My university account wasn't working after I left and neither was my email. Nobody contacted me. So they just sent it to collections. I left Feb 2019.

University is saying they can't do anything and they're sorry. Debt collection agency is charging almost $1,000 on top of my debt charge just to do the collection service. Is this normal for this agency? Is there anyway I can get the service fee lowered?

CRedit,"I am looking to buy / build a home in either late 2021 or 2022.  I've got some cash saved for a down payment and I was curious what rates I might be able to get, what payments might look like, etc.  Trusted individuals suggested that when I am ready for a mortgage I try Rocket.

I filled in some info on Rocket Mortgage, curious to see what they would estimate, and next thing I know I have a Hard Pull on my credit (and it approved me, but damnit I didn't want to or intend to apply for anything!).

I don't feel that I approved this Hard Pull, given that it didn't warn me and I feel that I checked all the boxes vaguely related to ""not right now"" but ... is this something I can legally dispute?  Or would I get flagged for fraud or something because like it or not it's a legitimate pull?

...secondly, how long will this actually affect my score for?  Because my score immediately jumped down 15 points.  I know the Hard Pull will stay listed for 2 years if I don't get it removed, but does it actually affect me for that long?  Or will the affect be neutralized in a few months?

CRedit,"Throwaway because obviously. I need some advice about my debt clock. I have a credit card that I defaulted on three years ago (in my state, OR, the SOL is six years). It has been canceled by grantor and sold to a collector. I’m in a position where I can make a partial payment, less than 50%, and want to attempt to negotiate a settlement or even hopefully a pay for delete. However, in order to negotiate I feel like I would have to acknowledge the debt, and wouldn’t this reset the SOL six year clock? If they refuse to negotiate or pay for delete, am I stuck at six years from now simply from making that attempt? If I make the partial payment, does that show for six years from time of payment or time of default? TIA for any help possible!"
CRedit,"My wife and I purchased a car the other day, and put $1k on our credit card that we wanted to immediately pay $600 off with cash after. The amount is showing as ""pending"" on the card, so there is technically only around $100 actually spent on the credit card till the pending balance is applied.

Can we pay $600 towards it now before the pending balance posts, or will it reject the payment since the $1k isn't officially posted yet?"
CRedit,"I just checked my credit report with equifax and it says my credit score is 552 with no debt or cards or literally ANYTHING, but I was told earlier this year that someone had opened a card and got a job with my social security number and so for that I just put a freeze on my credit, but I also know for a fact I have medical debt which isn’t showing up on my credit either. 

I want to dispute the fraud but I have nothing on the website to dispute. 


I don’t want to use all my credit reports in one day but do I check the other 2 websites other than Equifax as well to check for fraud or my medical debt?

Automod told me to update with type of credit but I literally have none or so it says. I’ve never had a credit card in my life."
CRedit,"In the United States, and around the world, being able to get better opportunities depends on the credit score you have. Credit scores are used when applying for certain jobs, to rent or buy a home, when buying something on credit like a car or a cell phone, opening an account to get Internet connectivity, or getting utility services. Lower prices and interest rates are given to people with better credit scores. This system keeps the poor, poor. It ensures that people who do not have a good credit score cannot get access to the same prime services reserved for those who do, generally those with more money. In the United States, the credit score of one spouse can affect the other.
If the system was fair, lower interests and prices would be given to the people with lower scores who are generally poorer, to help them make their payments on time while giving them access to the same buying power and services those with money and good credit score can get. But the credit system failed its purpose: to put people on the same level regardless of social differences when scoring their creditworthiness. The credit system is set up to be a collective legal way of economic discrimination that rewards the rich. When credit scores are used in hiring and salary decisions, using credit score data and social characteristics can disproportionally affect women and black applicants. According to Rourke L. O’Brien and Barbara Kiviat's research paper ""Disparate Impact? Race, Sex, and Credit Reports in Hiring"", ""Part of the promise of employers’ using seemingly objective information like what is contained in credit reports is that by basing hiring decisions on person-specific information, the influence of sex, race, and other social categories will be minimized. Our survey experiment shows how the inclusion of such information can actually accentuate social differences, not eliminate them. When we included credit reports among other job-application materials, the hiring outcomes of female and black applicants changed relative to those of men and whites, with bad credit doing more to hurt the prospects of both women and blacks, in terms of recommendation to hire and starting salary."" 
The plight for equality for minorities of color and women starts here. The legal system is already set up to deal with people who do not pay as agreed. We do not need a system that is set up to perpetuate financial social discrimination. This is the systemic racial practices the current movement needs to change.

CRedit,"I do not have any debt and never borrow money. I have two credit cards and I pay them off every month. My credit score has been over 800-900 for 10+ years.

I typically don't care much about my credit score as I don't borrow large sums of money. All my vehicles are paid for with cash. We are looking to purchase a house in the next year so my credit score's importance has shifted a bit as it is a factor to get a mortgage.

This morning I got an alert from creditwise that there was a change and my score dropped by 142 points. Below are the two changes that have occurred on the accounts.

1. I had a $36k credit limit that dropped to $500. This was on my longest active CC. I hadn't used it in years so I just figured they figured why bother giving this guy all this credit.
2. That same credit card got charged twice by two places that rarely ever send me bills. I had no idea the charges had come and didn't pay them for over two months.

I'm a private wealth member of this bank where I hold deposits accounts, savings accounts, and this credit card.

It was clearly my fault but I feel like there should be some goodwill when they look at how much money I carry with them and my history. I would have paid it if I had seen these charges. I got zero notification that I had an overdue bill. 

**What is the best way to tackle this?**"
CRedit,"Someone said to me last year - you really should have cash-back or something as you run a lot of charges through your cards (I used to travel A LOT before COVID) so I got a Discover IT card with cashback, which was sort of a half-assed attempt to switch to all cash-back cards.

I then called my Bank who issued my AMEX and asked if there was a cash-back card....after much discussion the answer was no.

I've had a capital one platinum whatever card for ten years now. I've had one limit increase during that time and its not really a thing that I think much about...after talking to my bank about my AMEX I thought I would call Cap-One and see if I could ""switch"" - experienced a long hold time on the call and I hung up - talking to them about it fell off my radar.

Today, I get an email from them saying:

*Thank you for being a Capital One® cardmember. We’re pleased with your track record, and we’d like to recognize your loyalty with an exclusive offer to apply and earn 1.5% cash back on purchases.*

*It’s confirmed! You’re now eligible to apply for a new Quicksilver® Mastercard® from Capital One® because of how responsibly you’ve used your existing Capital One credit card. Once approved...blah, blah, blah...*

(I get the ""buy a car!!"" emails from them all the time and delete them)

Does this mean that they want me to get a Quicksilver card in addition to my regular card? Swap them out? I don't really know what this means but it has renewed my interest in moving over to all cash-back cards.

I have an ""okay to meh' credit score of 650 (Discover) due to being an authorized user on an Ex's card that she carries a big balance on and an old collection account that I need to deal with.

Tell me things, oh great Reddit hivemind."
CRedit,"So my credit score is pretty bad and Credit Karma recommended OpenSky Secured Credit Card. I recently signed up for it because I couldn’t get approved for the capital one secured card due to an open balance with them which has since then been resolved. I know closing a card can negatively impact your score and I don’t want to go any lower than it already is but I haven’t activated my OpenSky card yet. Since it hasn’t been activated would it affect my credit score if I close the account? 

I wanted to get the Capital One secured card, since it has a lower initial deposit, no annual fee and they also increase your credit limit after 6 months with no additional money deposited. In comparison, I had to put down $200 for OpenSky for a $200 credit limit that won’t increase unless I add more money and they also have an annual fee. Overall the capital one card is just looking better long to me."
CRedit,"I know the Vantage score means very little, but I had to laugh when I logged into Credit Karma this morning and saw my scores got updated. Both reflected the exact same 2 changes, a credit limit increase and a utilization increase since i hadn't paid the bill yet. There were no other changes to any accounts in any way, and both had the same dollar amount as the utilization. One score was improved by 12 points for the changes and the other dropped 12 points for the same changes. 

It really is a guessing game as to what is going on and how scores are calculated."
CRedit,"Has anyone actually gotten their Venmo (not Venmo card) debt or insufficient funds sent to a debt collection agency? I heard they are threatening it, but I've been looking around and haven't seen any info on Venmo actually going through with it. If you have seen them do it, how much was the debt and how did it affect the credit score?"
CRedit,Equifax says my credit is fair and Credit Karma says it’s in the high numbers of “Good”. Credit Karma also shows that I owe a company that Equifax doesn’t show. Which one is legit?
CRedit,"I've had an account with Experian for awhile now but I usually never paid for extra features because all I ever really cared about was seeing my credit score. Anyway it's been awhile since I've checked experian but I made a new account for my dad today and the website won't let us view his credit score without paying for that $1 free trial. We can only access the stuff on his report. 

We were able to use creditkarma to check the scores for him just fine, but creditkarma doesn't give you the experian score. One of his scores is allegedly quite lower and we're assuming it's the Experian one based on what we saw. 

A few weeks ago I noticed that I was recently subscribed to the experian premium membership even though I had no recollection of doing that myself... anyway my premium benefits expire september 3rd because I immediately unsubscribed when I saw that on my credit card bill so I'm guessing I'll no longer be able to check my credit score after that date. I just know that in the past I was able to check my score for free."
CRedit,"Well I made the last payment on my outstanding credit card and now have no outstanding debt. I was in a situation at school that required me to take out money that I knew I couldn’t pay back right away, but as of now I am paid in full. Credit score sitting at 511 (Vantage from Chase), what steps do I take now to begin to rebuild? My past reckless ways have dug me into a deep hole, and now I have no idea on which direction to head.

CRedit,"I recently took out my first credit card in order to buy a plane ticket, since I was able to get a $200 statement credit plus 20,000 miles once I spend $1000, which is pretty close to what the price of the ticket is anyway. I didn’t want my credit utilization to show up as being very high, since my limit right now is only $1000, so I paid it off immediately after, well before my statement closing date. Moving forward, is it better to pay in full before my closing date or should I leave some to pay right after?"
CRedit,"This is a random question but I've seen someone talk about this.
Basically she said a way to increase credit score really fast is to do one payment 15 days before it's due, and then another payment 3 days before it's due. This apparently works better than just doing one payment. Is this true?"
CRedit,"I was denied an auto loan for lack of credit history. I have 3 open accounts, with the oldest one dating back three years. (All cc’s)My current credit score is around 685. I make around 750$/week. I find it hard to gain credit history when I can’t even get accepted for an auto loan. Would it be worth going through a credit union? Never dealt with them before. They also never take into account my wages, at the dealership I previously went to. Thanks for any help!"
CRedit,"I totally didn't keep track of my secured Discover card last month and spent $295 out of the $300 credit. Saw my statement just a couple weeks ago and paid off $220, which gives me a current balance of $75 but my score plummeted on TransUnion and Equifax in Credit Karma. 

I'm guessing this is because I went over the 30% utilization but I didn't expect it to drop that much. 

What can I do to get it back? Should I call Discover? I spent 6 months building my credit and I don't want to lose all of the progress from 1 small mistake!"
CRedit,"So I'm relatively new to the credit game (I'm only 19) got my first credit card a year ago, and am currently at 3 cards, capital one platinum, chase freedom, and Amex everyday, I'm currently at 710 credit score (I just got my amex so that has not been reported yet) and about 5 months ago I put my sister on as an authorized user on my capital one card, since I don't really use it given that there are no points benefits, and her credit score was down and I wanted to help. So far it has boosted her score around 80 points from a 540 to a 620. So I was wondering, I have a friend who has done almost all the same things as me credit wise, and I was wondering if we put each other as authorized users on each other's cards, if that would boost both of our scores (obv not as much as it did my sister since we both already have good credit) or if it wouldn't really make a difference. Keep in mind aswell we have been friends for years, and there would be no issue of trust with using and paying off both of the cards."
CRedit,"Hello guys, I have come here because I am at my wit's end with Transunion. So basically me and my brother are twins and we have the same birthdate, and the same first and last name but our middle names are different. Yeah, it's pretty stupid I know. Anyways, I keep disputing a student loan with Credit Karma that is supposed to be under my twin's credit report but they keep denying it and saying the information is correct. I would have guessed that they might have our middle names and social security numbers to differentiate us, but if they don't I could see how they would get confused. Does anyone know anyway that I can directly get in contact with them to prove that the information should be under his name? Thanks for reading and any help would be greatly appreciated."
CRedit,Is it okay to pay my credit card 2-3 times a month ?  Any suggestions on how to boost my score ?  Any usually what day of the month does the credit card report to the credit bureau
CRedit,I'm taking a look at places within my price range as I'm going through a divorce and will need to file bankruptcy. I'm hoping to sell my home so that I don't foreclose but I may try to do a deed in leui of if I can't sell the home quickly. I'm planning to file a chapter 7 and have spoken to an attorney. I don't have anyone to cosign but I currently have enough for the deposit. I suppose I'm trying to figure out if I'm doing the right thing by getting into a new place quickly as I know I can't handle the mortgage on my own and my husband is no longer contributing.
CRedit,"Been trying to improve my score to get better rates for mortage pre-approvals soon, also debating on when to start getting pre-approval. Wife had to have an unexpected surgery, and we did not want to touch our 10k we have in a CD for our down payment, which forced me to utilize more than I wanted on my cards. Fico8 score is 701, my UL 41%. We have two car loans, both from a FCU, no missed payments, around 3k on one and 11k left on the other. I want to try to improve my score as much as possible, obviously the utilization is important, but i'm wondering if applying for another card would help out, or maybe even asking my CU for a limit increase to help with utilization even more. I have been trying to read this sub to get and idea of what else I can do to improve, but i'm stuck at paying down and waiting a bit longer."
CRedit,"I am in Oregon. Applied online for a checking account, and then received an email from credit Karma that I had a mortgage inquiry on my account.

I emailed the CUnion and the rep was defending it saying that its normal, and they have to check credit. I replied that doesn't makes sense why it was a mortgage inquiry, and she repeated the same thing.

I tried to go online and dispute it, but I literally just kept clicking links that didn't take me anywhere on TransUnion.

I'm 25, I dont have anyone to ask for advice, any help is appreciated, thank you.

Edit: I have a Vantage score of 639. It was at 625 when they ran it which is why I'm mostly irritated because they cost me money in interest. Per my Chase Mobile app, 'Credit Journey', it says my Experian FICO score is 723."
CRedit,"I’ve been making great strides in my effort to repair my credit and I went from high 4’s to 560.  I have $775 between two cards and I paid it all off last week.  Credit Karma simulator predicted a 35 point raise to 595 at which point I planned to apply for a discovered secured.  I paid off the entire balance and with my most recent update, it shows my equifax took a 77 point hit and my transition took a 55 point hit.  Under “what changed” it simply says my card balances decreased.

Like what the actual fuck.  I know credit karma is iffy and the swing margins in their scores but credit wise through capital one shows the same thing

I’m trying 🥺"
CRedit,"In June 2018, I had a bank account closed as Profit and Loss write off for a total of $205. I had it removed from my equifax from a person I hired, but I can't be in contact with him (I think he ran off). Is it a possibility that I could call the original creditor and negotiate the terms of paying it off in exchange for the derogatory/collection to be removed from my credit reports? Or is there any other way to do this? I'm trying to get every negative remark off my credit reports."
CRedit,"I have heard that you need at least three lines of credit to apply for a mortgage. I currently have 2. I'm considering opening a second credit card with Chase, would that count as a separate line of credit since I already have a credit card with Chase?"

## 				  

 

Long story short, I am in the process of buying a house. I have  5 disputes that are over a year old.  They are no longer active, but  the remarks from the investigation is left. 

If I remove  the remarks, will that affect my credit score?  I recently did this for  Equifax but I believe they were active disputes and that caused my score  to drop 40 points. I followed suit with TR and nothing happened to my  score at all.  I am super nervous about this and not sure how to gauge  whether it will affect my score or not.

I'm assuming that if the disputes close the negative account begins to ding the credit from that point?  Is that correct?"
CRedit,"4 years ago I had two credit cards with Capital One. They both were charged off for the amounts of $2500 and $575. The lower balance was sold to a collection agency who I was able to get a pay for delete. The $2500 balance is still charged off and I want to pay it off but it’s not sold to a collections agency. I haven’t been contacted by anyone, no calls and no letters. Should I just speak to someone at Capital one? I’d like to negotiate for less if possible. Any advice? Thanks

Edit: I should clarify that if I pull my report it just shows it under Capital one"
CRedit,"In early 2019, I had a 60 day late payment on an department store card with a $250 limit. Once I realized, I immediately paid the card in full and closed the account. A bit less than a month ago I called the store's credit reporting line and groveled for a goodwill adjustment. The store agreed to the adjustment and the kind woman on the line mentioned the delinquencies would be removed around the beginning of August.

I have yet to see these changes take place on any of the credit reporting. How long do these take?

Other info:
I have 1 open credit card with a $2,500 limit, paid in full a bit before each reporting cycle (never higher than 10% utilization). I also have a $27,000 student loan account with no delinquencies over 2 years. Account history is 6 years, 11 months with average account age 4 years, 5 months. I have 4 hard inquiries.

My Experian FICO 8 currently sits at 677. I was hoping for this to skyrocket with the delinquencies taken off so I can then apply for a credit card with a higher limit and solid bonus rewards since I have some life changes coming up that require some spending. Any other tips you'd have on how to build my credit would be wonderful."
CRedit,"I want to open a store visa card to get a specific deal on an item but am scared that it'll hurt my credit. 

I have very good credit. 740-760 depending on which scoring model you look at. I don't need the credit card at all but it saves me $100 on something I was going to buy out of pocket, just for applying.

The last big thing I applied for was a self builder loan back in January. Before that, I applied for a credit card April 2019. 

My loan amount has only about $300 left. 
Both of my previous credit cards are paid in full. 
My credit history on average is 1 year and 11 months old. 

If I open the account just for the deal, and then close it shortly after, how will that affect my credit?"
CRedit,So essentially someone opened a credit card in my name and its payment history is superb. It has a 20k limit. My credit is not good and I don’t want to report it bc unfortunately it’s the only bright spot on my credit report. The only issue is they have not been utilizing it the past couple of years. Is there any way I can call the bank and have the card sent to Me so that I may take advantage of it?
CRedit,"When I was young and stupid, I had like 4 bank accounts that I racked up debt ranging from $20-$300 each account and ended up closing them all. Ever since then every bank I go to says I can't set up an account or get a loan or anything because checksystem or something has me flagged with 4 delinquent accounts for 4 different banks and tht I will need to settle my disputes with those banks before opening an account. 


So for the past 3 years of my life I've just been using online banking services like Dave, Chime, and Moneylion(never again). I've repaired my god awful credit score over the past 2 years and finally have roughly a 630 score and have maintained a job for over a year. I want to go look at car loans to get a cheap, used car to get to and from work... CapitalOne keeps sending me emails to get pre-approved from a car loans. 

I want to get a car loan. But I want to compare rates between CapitalOne and the local banks. 

My question is, is there a service to find what all banks I owe money to so I can call them and get this debt paid off? 

None of the banks have reported the debt to the credit agencies."
CRedit,"Sorry for any typos, I'm on mobile right now. 
I think the best way to expand on this question is with an example. Let's say I bought a candy bar and the utilization was under the recommended 3%, would it be better to pay that off before the end of the payment cycle or would it be better to leave it on the card then pay it off when the new payment cycle starts?"
CRedit,"I am just curious based on other people’s experience what a realistic credit score goal is by the end of this year. My Experian Fico 8 score is currently at 590 and I am making progress. 

Current credit limit $15000 across 4 cards (Amex Delta gold, US Bank Rei, Citi Costco, Capital One quicksilver. I will be under 10% usage by the end of the year (shooting to carry no balance/only enough to show usage). Current utilization is 95%. 

Average account length 5 years 3 months. 

Payment history is perfect for the last 24 months. A couple of 30 day lates before then and one 120 day late. 

I also have some charged off cards that have all since been paid off. Last charge off was over 3 years ago. 

I have one personal loan that I have never missed a payment. Don’t plan on paying this off before the end of the year but will make all my payments on time. 

I have two account in collections that will be paid off by the end of next month. Both companies agreed to pay for delete within 30 days of the final payment. 

My end goal is not a mortgage (house paid for in full already) but instead to have access to better credit cards for travel as I will be traveling more and more for work once that is a thing again. Specifically I would like to get the Amex platinum or Chase sapphire reserve. 

If I follow through with my plan to payoff and  remove collections, lower utilization and continue to improve payment history can I get to this goal by the end of the year or should I expect to have to wait longer? I know credit improvement takes time but I like to have goals and try to meet them."
CRedit,I know someone who is really struggling with low credit and is trying to raise their credit score so they can get a loan to help move out of a shady part of town. They only have a minimum wage job and take public transport. What would you suggest for them to raise their score and start moving up in the world? (FICO)
CRedit,A collection item appeared on my Experian for a small amount under $100. It was for a cable company charge from 1 year ago that was sent to collection agency. I went back and made sure the account was closed properly and the last bill was paid in full. Have no idea what it is for as my records show all monthly bills paid. Should I call the collection agency and offer to pay for delete just to get rid of it or dispute or what?

22% UTIL,  17 year history 

I have a 2017 model Ford with less than 54Kmiles EX edition with all the bells and whistles appraised by PenFed at $31.6K blue book. 

Original loan $26.5k with Capital One 9.5% APR. I pay and additional $50-100 per month towards the principal making this a pricey loan I want to pay down faster. My note is $471.34 and PenFed offered me a 3.4% used car rate. 

My current loan balance is $20k with a 10 day payoff. The loan officer said everything looked good. Today I received a denial saying “Bill obligations not met. Length of time unknown”


The only derogatory on my Eq is a medical bill that isn’t mine and keeps popping up due to another person with same name. It’s been removed 4xs. Also I had a late payment on an old closed guitar center account due to them not updating my address in 2015 but I have a 100% payment history and own a home with equity. 

In addition to the Ford loan I have a 2nd vehicle financed with Capital One. Both loans are paid on time with early payoff. 

Has anyone had success with reconsideration with PenFed? They didn’t even ask for a co-signer or ask for additional options to push the refinance through. Seems odd as it’s secured by a vehicle they appraise and verified. 

Should I send a CMRRR or an email? Any direct dept contact info would be greatly appreciated."
CRedit,"Hi all - I could really use any advice you have to offer because I made a big mistake and I’m destroyed by anxiety right now. 

So the backstory is that I am a year into postdoc life after 7 years of grad school, and during the last part of those seven years I racked up a lot of credit card debt (I knoooowww I should have been more responsible but I was making basically poverty wages and really struggling to meet basic needs so ... credit cards). I guess not a LOT relative speaking but it feels crushing to me ($1000 on a credit union, $1500 on a discover it unsecured and $3000 on a bank of america travel rewards). Anyway now that I’ve been in postdoc I’ve been steadily trying to pay these down but my postdoc doesn’t pay very well and I live in a very expensive city and also have student loans so it’s been really slow going. I knew my credit was being hurt by high utilization but was doing my best to chip away and never missing payments etc and last I checked I was hovering in the mid 600s. 

Flash forward to today when I decide to check my score (whatever the free fico score check that Discover gives you) and noticed that my score has just dipped into the poor range at 579 and I was shocked and couldn’t figure out why! I finally discovered the culprit: a few months ago, my bank of america card upped its monthly minimum payment for me (it was $40 a month and I was paying $100, they upped it to $140) and I never got any notification of it. I’m signed up for estatements and notifications but because I was still paying a monthly fee it never registered as late - I was just underpaying for four months. (and I know this is terrible but I didn’t read the statement each month - I don’t use the card and figured I was just slowly chipping away). Anyway it has now registered as four missed months of payments and they closed the card. I called in a panic when I realized and they said they couldn’t do anything since I did obviously underpay and therefore missed payments - and they’re right. Obviously I would love to just pay it all off right now but that would pretty much demolish the meager savings I’ve slowly built up with the aim of having a down payment for a new (used) car this year. I took $1200 from savings to pay off as much as I could now but that still leaves a little under $1800 and a demolished credit score. Plus my other credit cards and student loans etc. And I guess no chance of getting a halfway decent used car. 

Anyway I’m so angry with myself and also embarrassed; I feel like I’ve been trying so hard to pull myself out (slowly!!!) of bad financial habits and now I’m an idiot with a terrible credit score. And not a lot of financial literacy. So reddit ... I could really use any guidance you have for me.

(edit: fixed typo)"
CRedit,"Throwaway because obviously. I need some advice about my debt clock. I have a credit card that I defaulted on three years ago (in my state, OR, the SOL is six years). It has been canceled by grantor and sold to a collector. I’m in a position where I can make a partial payment, less than 50%, and want to attempt to negotiate a settlement or even hopefully a pay for delete. However, in order to negotiate I feel like I would have to acknowledge the debt, and wouldn’t this reset the SOL six year clock? If they refuse to negotiate or pay for delete, am I stuck at six years from now simply from making that attempt? If I make the partial payment, does that show for six years from time of payment or time of default? TIA for any help!"
CRedit,"I’m 21 with a 765 credit score. I currently have an auto loan and 10k in student loans. I’m going to pay all of my loans off right now but they’re divided into three accounts. I’m assuming they will all close, but will this lower my score because I’m technically closing three accounts?"
CRedit,"I’m trying to refinance right now because of low interest rates but my credit score took a huge hit because of ~70% revolving utilization for close to a year. I just now paid off enough to bring me to about 29% utilization. I want to go conventional but I’m thinking my score (fico currently 655) is going to hurt me. Will this bring me back up to mid 700s?

I’ve never missed a payment or paid late I just made some bad decisions with my cc. 

I also don’t want to escrow my taxes because I overpay about $2500 each year. 

What are my options/likelihood of getting a good rate and not having to escrow with an fha?"

CRedit,"I have a charge off that is due to fall off in 2023, Id like to settle it since it won’t be on my credit report in about two years and I won’t be purchasing a house in that time(though I will be apt hunting). I’ve always been under the impression that things like collections and charge offs completely disappear off credit reports after around 7 years, but I came across a few Reddit/myfico threads of people have issues getting a credit card due to charge offs that were 10 years old. Do these things not fully disappear? Is there a way to manually pull up negative items from a credit report that is older than 7 years?"

They're looking at cars 15-20K and have about 5K to put down. The problem is the SO has a completely empty credit file (just got a secured card a few weeks ago) and the cousin in law has a very thin file with 1-2 credit cards with an average age of maybe a year.

They both just got denied for a store card at a local furniture place because I they stupidly applied after I told them not to.

Are there higher rate lenders for this type of credit? I would advise them to maybe go with a slightly hire than market rate for a year and then refinance if they can."
CRedit,"I did post this on another thread, however the conversation I just had with Ally deserves its own.

After months of no reporting, Ally reported 2 late payments incorrectly for January and February 2020 (we have paid on time, every time). Credit score went down dramatically in May, thus rendering me no longer able to get a mortgage. We were aiming to buy this month.

I disputed via CK on the TU account in June and that came back closed as apparently Ally ""confirmed"" the incorrect info 30 days later.  My wife called Ally again, they confirmed 100% payment record, insisted they had corrected it with the TU and Eq, however neither TU or Eq show that info; I spoke to both.   I spoke to Ally and they again confirmed they are showing 100% payment record and would send a letter to that effect, so we could send that to the credit ref agencies.  Why the onus is on us to do all the work, I don't know....

We just received that letter from Ally (11 days later) and it incorrectly shows 2 x 30 Days late.  

I called Ally, they have admitted an issue with their system and it'll take 45 further days to correct.

I've told them this needs sorting in the next week, or I'll speak to an attorney.

We have a claim, right?"
CRedit,"Hello 
So my fico experian score recently dropped by 40 points. I have one credit card that I pay every month on time and in full. I've has this card for about two years now and try to keep a 3% utilization. Last month I  didn’t spend much on my credit card so I had a 0% utilization. I have one student loan that is not in collections. I am paying on that every month. I didn’t open any new accounts. The last account that was closed was last year. 

My other scores didn't change (based on vantage and fico 9). 

Would anyone know why my credit score dropped so low? I have the free version of the Experian report so I can only check that one from the site. I also use credit karma to check my other reports. I don’t have any changes or anything that looks suspicious. 
I think it might be from my lack of spending/credit usage for this period but I want to get opinions. I didn’t think my score would drop so low because of low activity. 

Is this common? 

Is it worth freezing my report just in case?"
CRedit,I already have a debit card with all my money in it so I dont need a credit card. I only got this card to build my credit. My question is do I just buy chips once a month to show utilization?
CRedit,"So about a month ago I had posted about an incorrect balance being reported on all 3 bureau reports.

I had an old Barclay Mastercard account from 2016, that was sent to collections in 2017.

The account was transferred to LTD Financial, which is the collection agency.

I paid off the balance of $1900, within 2 months, and I have the bank statements to prove it.

With that being said, I called Barclay and they told me that the collection agency has the responsibility of updating the bureau's once the account is paid in full.

They also offered to send me a letter confirming that the account was in fact at a $0 balance. 

With everything going on with the USPS, I have yet to receive that letter, almost a month later.

However, I do have the bank statements. Would that be enough to submit as proof if I submit a dispute to the agencies? Or should I wait to see if the letter from Barclay pops up? 

Also, since LTD has failed to update the account to the bureaus for almost 3 years at this point, does that put them in some sort of violation?"
CRedit,"Like many on this board, I’m in the process of fixing my credit and hoping to qualify for a mortgage within the next 6 months. I only have two collection accounts (two different credit cards, both with Portfolio Recovery) which are now about 5-6 years old. One will be outside the statute of limitations in my state within 4 months, and the other still has about a year left before being out of SOL. The total of both collections combined is just over $3,000. The debts are mine and I know they are hurting my scores because of the monetary amount being calculated towards my debt as well as being the only two collection accounts I have. I’m in a much better financial situation now and would be able to pay them if it means getting them off my report.

My question is how to go about this? I have heard Portfolio will often do a pay for delete and often for a smaller amount than what is owed. I don’t want to restart the statute by simply offering to pay and acknowledging the debt but I’m assuming if I dispute any of this through the credit bureaus it will poke the bear and they’ll reach out wanting the money anyways. I have not heard anything from the collection agency in years, I believe the last contact was a settlement offer back in 2016.

I’m also hoping to strengthen my score by paying down my student loans to less than half of what is owed since I only owe $5,000 or so now (the only other debt I have on my credit report) and also getting a credit card and making small payments to improve my credit utilization portion of the score. 

If anyone has any suggestions I’d appreciate it. I have not tried applying for a mortgage but I was assuming having these two collection accounts would be automatic grounds for denial even if everything else was okay on my application."
CRedit,"I just received a letter from a courthouse that a old account I completely forgot about was sold off and they are wanting to go to court over it. Within a couple days I got a letter from a debt attorney saying they have a 99% win chance in these situations. I only pay the law firm if they win, but if they lose I’m assuming the judge would grant them a judgement against me. My questions is, should I try to call the creditor and settle this outside of court? Or take the chance with the Attorney in hopes they can win?"
CRedit,"Hi, I am trying to refinance 15-17k in mostly credit card debt with typical high interest rates. I belong to a credit union which I trust and have used for 20 years. I have excellent credit (somewhere btn 700-800) and a stable job making 50k. I own my home with a prime mortgage along with my gf, and we also jointly own a rental house and get $850/month from that. I’m applying for a loan by myself, not jointly, so I’m not using the property to secure it. The best my CU will do is 7% on a personal line of credit. 

Should I expect to do better? I thought I should considering interest rates as published in the news are down down down. Am I correct that I can’t get a secured loan with my jointly owned property? Anything else I should consider? 

Thanks"
CRedit,"I took on two separate self lender loans to help my rebuild my credit score. I've been with both for about 6 months but I'm thinking I should close these accounts and use the money saved with them to pay down a balance on a credit card that I was told by my (future) mortgage lender needed to have it's balance lowered to $XXX. So, should I close the lender accounts and take a chunk out at the credit card debt, or keep the self lender accounts and keep nibbling at the credit card? Ultimate goal is to raise my score. Thanks in advance!"
CRedit,Trans union and experion aren’t correctly reporting on two accounts. Experion actually isn’t reporting one at all. I only can get through on the phone to an automated system. What are my options?
CRedit,"Hello 

So a few months back I fixed my credit score I got it from a 480s in all bureaus to a 702 in transunion, 708 in equifax and a 697 in experian... now here I thought I paid everything all my collections all my debt and only have 1 auto loan that has never been paid late and 8 credit cards that are also paid and never been paid late, so after one year my score has gone up and I was very aware of the difference in Vantage and Fico8 but here I thought ""hey im at 700s in my Vantage score I should be good then lets apply for a mortgage"" so I did and they obviously pulled my credit from a company called Informative Research, and turns out the scores they got are as follows,  650 experian, 648 equifax and 630 transunion... now I still got pre approved but to my surprise it was much lower than what I expected... then again I was careless in just  thinking I was gonna be fine... I just made a fool out myself telling my loan officer that in fact I had a 700+ when in reality I dint ....

Let this be an opportunity for everyone to learn from my mistake..."
CRedit,"I've recently noticed that my score is dropping for seemingly no reason. 

My credit usage is consistently below 20%, my payments are all on time, I haven't had a credit inquiry in almost a year, and I have 10+ accounts. Nothing has really changed much in the past few months , but my FICO dropped 15 points and my Vantage dropped 25 points.

Anyone know why I keep dropping?

I use Mint, Chase, and BofA to monitor my scores."
CRedit,"We just received a collections notice (first one) from Avante USA for a medical bill from 2016. The bill amount is 306$ but they are saying they’ll accept 112 so satisfy debt. 

Now this debt is not being reported to the credit bureaus . It has the verbiage that we have 30 days to dispute or debt is consider valid Yada Yada 

My question is-if we call today and pay the debt will they still report it to the credit agency? Definitely don’t want it to! 

Thanks for any advice."
CRedit,"I paid off 3 different collections accounts that were on my credit for less than 6 months. My credit went up about 25 points each, but I had filed a dispute because I had paid those accounts off 3 months earlier and they were still showing as unpaid. Well, it showed that they were all paid, and then about a week later, they were all removed from my credit because my dispute went through. My experian didn't change, but my Equifax went down 23 points, and my Transunion went down 42 points, which is less than what it was before they were paid off. 


When I called Transunion, they said I could call the original credit and ask for them to be readded to my credit, and that that may help. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I try?"
CRedit,"Hi Everyone,

This is kind of a weird question, but I am going through a background investigation and they are asking ""In the last seven (7) years**,** you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?"" I'm not really sure how to tell that based off my credit report. 

A few years ago I was having some financial issues and paid about 15 days late on some credit cards, but no more than 30 days late. As a result I had 2 credit cards cancelled, but I'm not sure if that was because of my credit score which had dropped or because failing to pay as agreed? The month that the account was cancelled was the first month in the account history that the payment was 30 days delinquent. 

There is a still a balance on one of the cards and according to my Equifax report the status is Pays\_As\_Agreed and the only comments say Account Closed by Credit Grantor. I just want to make sure I report this correctly and wanted to see if anyone knew a way to tell the exact reason why the account was closed?

Thanks for any help!"
CRedit,I got 27 late payments under my name. how fucked am i? they are all bout a year or 2 old
CRedit,"Can paying off a collection and increasing my credit limit on a secured card give me +15 points in 30 days?  Also I pulled CB scores from Exp and TU.  I talked to a lender who did a soft pull on TU and there was a minus 71 point difference.   When a lender does a soft pull would that number differ much from when they do a hard pull?  Also, does anyone have any advice on how to get Equifax to report my accounts?  I have a revolving and installment both over 3 years old.  Help?  I'm so confused."
CRedit,"Hello All!!!!

I am currently a student going into my sophomore year at Penn State University, and I had taken out the maximum amount of subsidized($3500) , and unsubsidized student loans ($2000) allotted for my freshman year. Specifically now, I actually only have $1462 in unsubsidized loans because I made sporadic payments throughout the school year. I was able to save a good chunk of money working this summer, so I am planning on knocking out my unsubsidized loan before the 0% interest rate period ends. From what I hear, federal student loans do not appear on your credit report until after you graduate, but is this actually true, and if I were to pay it off early, could it boost my credit score?"
CRedit,"For reference, my oldest account is 2 years, 3 months (auto loan), and my newest account is 3 months (this atrocious chime builder card I got to help with improving payment history). It's currently stating my average age is 1 year and 3 months. I'm wondering why it's not at least closer to 2 years between the two? Shouldn't both of those 3 months cancel each other out?"
CRedit,"Do websites like experian or creditkarma allow a person to dispute digitally in a fashion that actually works?

&amp;#x200B;

Or are sending letters the only true way to go about it?

  
Also, is it worth it to simply pay a credit repair company to do it or is that always a bad idea?

&amp;#x200B;

thank you to whoever answers this in advance."
CRedit,"New here so sorry for breaking rules.

I have good credit but that's because I'm afraid to use it and petrified of ruining it.  Hoping you guys can help me understand if using my credit will dramatically effect it.

Fico: 808/792  (Experian/Bank of America)  
Vatange 3.0: 761  (Credit Karma)  
Average History: 5.5/5.1 years$3,500 of available credit over 2 credit cards (paid off every month after they are reported to CK), the rest are student/auto loans.

Goal - want to apply for new credit but need to preserve my score.  In the 12-18 months, I want to purchase a house so maintaining a good score is 100% necessary.  (co-signor of house will only have \~680 Score).

What I want to do with my credit today

1. Refinance $50k in student loans.  Currently paying 7.1% and was quoted at 4.08% for a lesser term.
2. Apply for the citi double cash card for better rewards.  I'm approved via CK so I doubt it will deny. If this one is a no-go, I'm completely fine with it, just tell me!

Questions:

1. Will refinancing my loans hurt me because it's going to affect my average credit age?  I will be closing a 38 month account and opening a brand new one with a $50k balance.  This is going to save me nearly $100 a month without increasing the term, so I really feel like that's worth it but if saving $1,200.00 over 1 year is going to impact my house purchasing goal, I'm not sure it's worth it.
2. Similar fear of Credit age, I want to open a new credit card and close a 26 month old Bank of America Card that offers less rewards.

Bonus Question:  Should I put my fiancee as a cosigner on the Citi CC?  CK score is \~680 (she's on time with everything, her credit is just too new).  Would this increase her score or decrease mine?  Is this a wise choice prior to house purchasing or would it be better to wait for the house?

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate any of the help!"
CRedit,So the biggest factor impacting my score is the length of time my accounts have been open. So should I pay my loans that have the latest date received first so the average score goes up? Is there any point in doing this?
CRedit,"Hi guys,

I am confused about when to pay my credit card bill to optimize my score.

My due date is always on the 16th, but my statement date is different every month, usually somewhere between the 19-21st.  I’ve noticed that what affects the credit score is whatever the balance is on the statement date.  This month, my statement is on the 21st.

I always pay my credit card in full every month.  Last month, I paid in full on the due date of the 16th, however, by the time the statement date rolled around (I think on the 21st), I had already spent $500 more, and it made my credit score go down because the utilization was too high! Shouldn’t I be rewarded with an addition of points if I paid on my due date?

My question is: when do I pay to optimize my score (TransUnion &amp; Equifax on Credit Karma) and have my utilization close to 0% on the statement date? This month, I plan on skipping the due date and waiting till the 20th to pay everything off, so by the 21st, the utilization will be close to 0%, making my score go up.  But in afraid if I skip the due date of the 16th, I will get punished for it.  I also don’t want to have to pay more than once a month because that is tedious and annoying.

What should I do?

Thanks"
CRedit,"Hello I’m 20 and just applied for my 3rd card. 

I’ve read several articles that go back and fourth on the subject of 1% vs 0% and just don’t know If there is one better than other. I currently do 0% but I am curious if there is a better way.

Some say 1% because it shows more responsibility when having a balance carry over and you pay it on time. While others say 0% because it shows that you still spent money on the card that month but paid it off right away.

My question is that does anyone know if one is truly better than the other? Or is it so small of a change it’s basically nothing?"
CRedit,"So basically for a little over a year I've had above 105% utilization across all cards. Currently have 3 cards, limits are $2k, $500, $300. Recently I've paid off the $2k card completely, and paid $100 each on the smaller cards. Current score is 488/500 according to credit Karma, Discover, &amp; cap one. 

Both Cap 1 &amp; credit karma have a simulator so I put in how much I paid off to see if my score would go up, and it actually dropped? My balance before was $3150 since I was over the limit on all 3 cards, and I thought by paying off so much my score would go up. 

I know the simulator is an estimate and it hasn't actually updated it yet but does anyone have an idea of if it'll go up or not? 

If it helps, ive had 6 late payments in the past 3 years, my credit is only 4 years old, I have student loans, a car loan, and 1 acct in collections on my report. Not extremely diverse but its not all just cc's."
CRedit,"Hey... not an American but I thought I’d give it a shot asking for some general advice on an issue I’m having here, anyway.

I’ve been trying to check my credit score for like an hour now, but according to every single credit reporting agency, the information I’ve provided (that they’ve asked for) from my ID documents (valid driver’s license, Medicare card, et cetera) is all incorrect... yet this information is fine for anything else. I know I exist. I’m clearly here and these IDs work absolutely fine for literally anything else in life... but... what am I supposed to do?

How am I supposed to check my credit score when credit agencies can’t even find me on record with the (absolutely correct, triple checked) legal information I’ve provided?

I’m stumped, man. Thanks for any help."
CRedit,"I am planning to obtain credit and consumer reports from the following agencies. Have I missed anything?

TransUnion

Experian

Equifax

Innovis

PRBC

LexisNexis

Chex Systems

What info do auto insurance companies look at? Is it good idea to ask for CLI given the current pandemic scenario? I have decent limits across cards (total 110K), recently changed jobs with somewhat better household income, non-US citizens (SO and I), utilisation is about 20% with auto loan and cards combined, always on time payments.

Last year around this time, asked for Discover CLI, was sent a letter rejecting the request saying citing ""past due"". Checked TU report, there is nothing like past due/delinquent. I was confused, but too busy to bother then."
CRedit,"Long story short back in 2015 my company failed and I pretty much neglected my credit entirely. I was racking up expenses and just put everything on my credit cards...until I ran out of credit and ran out of money and sort of adopted the mindset that credit is just a number until I could get back on my feet.

Anyways, I'm in a much better financial position today and have some savings to resolve my past debts. However, I want to do it in a way that best resolves my credit issue too because not having credit cards, not being able to get a car loan, mortgage, etc sucks.

Here are my accounts that show up on my credit report as charge offs/closed, date of last payment was Dec 2015/Jan 2016 for all of them:

* AMEX -2.4k
* AMEX - 9
* AMEX - 3.3k
* BoA - 2k
* Discover - 5.2k
* Chase - 4.4k
* Chase - 5k
* Chase - 2.3k
* Syncb - Paid, was charge-off. Last update 2016
* Toyota Motors - Paid, 9 late payments. Last update 2017

Here are the ones that are listed as collections:

* Portfolio Recovery (Cap1): 2.4k
* Cavalry (citi): 7k
* Portfolio Recovery (Cap1): 531
* Portfolio Recovery (synchrony): 2.5k

I have 2 active secured credit cards. With 800 limit a piece and pretty much just $10 balance.

Here's my game plan, and I'm hoping to see if you guys can go over and offer any advice or what you would do differently.

I have $35k in savings right now and I'm trying to resolve it without wiping out my entire savings. Maybe $20k?

My plan's to tackle the collections first. I was going to offer the collections a reduced balance in exchange for delete or a settlement for less to show as paid in full. I have in writing from Cavalry that they will take 50% to satisfy the account in full, and I have 60 days to pay. Portfolio Recovery has not contacted me since 2017. So I was going to offer them 30% to satisfy all accounts in full.

I've been told that I should considering paying off Amex and Discover in full, as they're more forgiving for future cards? I know they have the highest limits. Amex has sent me settlement letters for months, I doubt any of the companies above will do pay for delete. A friend of mines told me I to ask AMEX for their bad credit card in return for full payoff, he did it during a bankruptcy in 2008 and eventually they moved him back up to a normal card and gave him preapproval for more. I think it's worth wild to not get blackballed by AMEX, anyone with experience?

Discover has not contacted me for years. Personally don't really care for discover. I was going to reach out and offer them 30% to resolve and work up from there.

BoA has sent me countless emails to settle for 30%, so I was thinking of just taking up their offer.

Chase...that's one I'd like to know more about. They've offered to settle at around 40%, but at the same time their cards have really good benefits and I'd like to eventually sign up for another one. The thing is do they black ball like AMEX?

My understanding is the collections are hitting my credit the hardest right now and that I should resolve those first since they go away once paid right? At least if negotiated that way.

Given the age of the delinquencies, does it matter if they are charge off settle vs paid in full? It doesn't impact the score right? Just credit worthiness in a manual review?

Ultimately my #1 priority is credit for credit cards and auto loan/lease. I'm trying to expand my new business and I have several contracts that will keep me real busy for the next 2-3 years at the very least, and I need the some kind of revolving credit. The points would be a cherry on top since I will have having inventory coming in and out. I'd like to eventually buy a 2nd house for rental purposes, so my credit will be manually reviewed, but I don't plan buy another until at least 2022 that way at least I have a lot more confidence about my current contracts and all my charge offs are set to fall off around that time.

My Experian fico8 score is 530 right now. Credit.com has my vantage 3 at 535-540. I'm hoping to bring my score up to 650-680. It seems doable since I do have some ability to pay right? Or am I setting my expectations too high? Sorry if this seems a little long."
CRedit,I’m planning to buy a home in the next 6 months and I want make sure I can raise my credit score as high as possible. Is it worth paying myFICO to get the mortgage score and others? Is there any other advantage?
CRedit,"How long can a collection company collect on a judgement? After recession defaulted on Discover for $1400. Collecfion company bought the debt and took me to court in CT. I didn't fight it as I was ashamed and Judgement was made in 2010 to repay. Lost job again and only made 3 payments. Fast forward to 2013 after moving and getting back to work.. Bank account was frozen and cleared out. They took $1800. I Contacted them right after they took our rent money. I updated that we had moved to FL and I asked on how to settle but They threatened that they would garnish me, freeze any bank accounts, and can now collect up to 3 times the new amount owed. Said they will collect up to 15k if i dont pay them another 5k immediately. Didn't seem right and I was upset, told them I won't pay another dime if they will still close accounts and or garnish me, even if I am on track with them. I hung up and have never heard from them since. No calls or letters.  With the threats made, I haven't had any banking accounts since 2013 or credit cards. My credit tanked of course but i recently checked and everything is gone. My credit report doesn't show the judgement or any collections from them. I need to be sure I am in the clear before moving forward in repairing andrebuilding my credit. How long can this judgrment be collected upon? How do I confirm if this is closed? What should be my next step to move forward? Your advise is kindly appreciated guys."

CRedit,"Hey y’all! I’ve always tried very hard to maintain my credit. I have about 25,000 in CC debt that I could manage to pay off. But now I have a $7000 bill from my apartment that we moved out of in February. Apparently they charged im us for the remainder of the lease. I pretty much refuse to pay this debt, I can’t imagine forking over 7k to an apartment complex. Help?! Will there be any sort of financial help to those with apartment bills because of Covid.

CRedit,"I'm planning on getting an FHA 203 loan about 10 months from now and would obviously like the lowest possible interest rate. I have a ~720 credit score but I'm thinking about getting a credit builder loan to help boost my credit score in preparation for the mortgage. My credit is too young and contains too few accounts and I have some spare cash to use for the loan so it seems like a good idea. However, I'm worried that 10 months isn't enough time for the positive impacts on my credit score to take effect. Thoughts?"
CRedit,"I am 23 years old and I currently have 2 credit cards. 
- WF AMEX Propel ($3000) opened on July 10 2019
- Chase Freedom Unlimited ($5,400) opened on May 15 2020

I also have a student loan account that has been open since August 2015.

Before I applied for the Chase card, my credit score was 764. It dropped a few points when I applied but then dropped down to 689 when the account got added to my credit history. 

It said it was because it made my “average age of accounts” much lower. My score has gone up a point or two each week to 706 now. 

I want to apply for the Amazon credit card just as something I think I will have for the rest of my life and only use it on amazon purchases. My question is should I wait until my credit score gets back up to the mid-700’s before I apply? I don’t want my score to go down to 620 even though I don’t really plan on financing anything in the near (2-3yr) future. 

I am thinking that opening the account will be beneficial in the long term as my average age of accounts increases so I want to open it ASAP. But I also don’t want my score to go too low right. 

I appreciate your time and advice."
CRedit,"Is there anyway to get a personal guarantee removed from your credit that someone else defaulted on?

CRedit,"Hi!

My very first car, a 2012 Chevy Cruze, has recently been having expensive issues (i.e. I've paid $4,500 to fix this car in the past 8 months) and I am seriously considering getting a new one (if I can get approved). 

The caveat is that I just ""bought"" a car for my fiance in April, although he has been making the monthly payments with his own money. We financed it under my name because his credit was horrendus and we've recently been rebuilding his credit since then. I just bought a house (under my name) in February and have since had a bit of credit card debt build up (which I have been working to pay off now that I have a second income to help).

We both have current credit scores around 620 and a combined income of $92,000/yr. His may jump as he just paid off the last collections on his account. Our monthly debt is around $2,400.

What are our chances of qualifying if we apply together using our combined incomes? The car I am looking at is $18,000."
CRedit,"About me
Background: Back in 2014, I had clawed out of college/post-college credit irresponsibility to get to a pretty decent credit score, but following some extended underemployment followed by personal issues intermingled with rash financial decisions/more credit irresponsibility, I had tanked my credit scores into the mid-400s by 2018. Well, I've spent the last year trying to claw back out of the hole again, but I still have a ways to go.

Income: $60,000

Rent: $0 - live with parents

Goal: get back to good credit standing, buy a house


Current credit situation

FICO 8 scores (from Experian):

EX 674

EQ 677

TU 667

 

5 Open Accounts

3 Revolving accounts (utilization currently at 1%)

Indigo MC, $300 CL, Opened 12/2019

Credit One Platinum Visa $300 CL, Opened 1/2020

Mission Lane Visa, $750 CL, Opened 8/2020

2 Installment accounts

1 Auto Loan First Investor Financial, Opened 8/2020 (just refinanced), 13% APR, Balance: $16,000, 72 months remaining, Monthly Payment $334

1 Secured Savings Loan through my CU, Opened 6/2020, 3% APR, $2500 balance, 12 months remaining, Monthly payment $212

Main Negatives:

Southeast Toyota Finance, 24 late payments, redeemed repossession, but eventually paid off (when I totaled it 🙄luckily I had GAP)

CapitalOne QuickSilver One, Charged off 9/2017, paid off in full 6/2020

CapitalOne Journey, Charged off 9/2017, paid off in full 4/2020

Discover it, closed around the same time as the CapOne cards, 5 late payments, paid off in full 6/2020

Mercury MC, charged off 6/2018, never paid off because the balance has disappeared off my credit report (aka reports as $0)

-Barclaycard MC, 3 late payments, sold to Mercury Bank 

Mattress Firm/WF, Charged off 9/2017, paid off in settlement 8/2019

 

I also have some older closed store cards (Dillards, Gap, Dell) that show up as either paid as agreed or unknown payment history. (I never used the Dell account and it was closed in 2007. Why is it still showing up??)

 

Questions

1. Where do I go from here? My goal is to raise my credit scores into the 750s. I want to buy a house by end of next year.

2. How do I tackle this Mercury/Barclay balance? It's around $8K but it doesn't appear anywhere on my credit report. Should I just go and pay it off proactively or let it come back before I tackle it? I have about $12k in savings but I'd like to get to $18k so I can pay it off in full and still have $10k saved (banking $1k a month in savings so I'd get there by next March).

3. My car is $6K under water. Should I prioritize getting my car above water to refinance or sell, or saving up the money to pay off the $8k missing Mercury balance?

 

Thanks"
CRedit,"I am in my mid-30s with a history of bad credit as I just kinda bounced around through life without really considering the impact it had on my financial future. I finally got my shit together and finished grad school about 1 year ago &amp; now have a well paying job, making around 150k a year, which I started at the beginning of this year. I bought a house with my fiancee. I have significant student loan debt and a car payment. I was forced to buy the car when my old one broke down during grad school &amp; I needed reliable transportation to be able to drive extended distances for school; this was co-signed with my fiancee. I pay everything on time now (sadly, pretty much for the first time in my life), but my credit score is basically staying at the same place. I know it's not going to be something that will change overnight, but I feel like there's gotta be more I can do to improve it. Here is my info:

* Mortgage - $208k; joint responsibility; opened in January of this year; 100% on-time payments

* Car payment - $10k; joint responsibility; 16 months old; 100% on-time payments

* Capital one credit card - $600 limit; 4 years old; 98% on-time payments with worst status 30 days late; last late payment 6/2018; I requested a credit limit increase several months ago, but it only increased me by $100 &amp; I am unable to request another increase until 6 months has passed

* Student loans - $155k; consolidated a few months ago; 100% on-time payments since finishing school last year

* I have a savings account with approx 15k in it &amp; a checking account I use for basic every day expenses 

* My current vantage score is 656. It has pretty much stayed here since May of this year 


Again, I'm pretty clueless about this stuff &amp; know I put myself in a shitty position based off poor decisions in my past, but appreciate any &amp; all feedback. Thanks!"
CRedit,"So I didn’t pay my paypal credit balance and it was reported.  I payed it off and also signed up for the Self credit builder loan.  I know a lot of people on here do not like Self but at the time I didn’t know what to do.  

My score has gone from 518 to 596 since late April from paying my debt and getting the self loan.  I was offered a secured Self credit card and don’t know if I should take it.  I am currently making all the payments on time for the loan and I have no debt.  I just want to know what steps I should take to raise my score.

Edit: I also may be looking for an apartment early next year and am wondering what is a ideal score to have."
CRedit,"Hello everyone,

my brother has a high credit score of 740-750 but only has 2 credit cards with low credit  limits of 3,000 on both cards. My question is, what steps can he take to use his cards to its full potential and take the advantage of having a high credit score and how can he drastically raise his limits?

Also what best Credit cards will accept him with his score?"
CRedit,I have put my credit repair into overdrive this past few months and monitor it like a hawk. I already went from 501 to 594 but yesterday I got a notice of a new account in collections that took me down a point. It was directv which I had 8 years ago for $280. I called directv and they told me it was for not returning equipment but they see they received it and put the balance at 0.00 it was their mistake. So what do I do w the collection agency on my report? Do I call and ask them to delete not close? It’s down a point but I don’t want it on my report at all. I would have caught it sooner but they said they have been emailing the bill and the email was wrong so it went this long.
CRedit,"Hey guys. I’m current.y 25 years old and have been working on building my credit for a little while now. I have 2 credit cards currently and have slowly been increasing the limits on the cards which has been working great. 

 Im in Canada so I’m currently using a 

BMO world elite air miles card 11k limit 
TD Cash back visa 3k limit (the no annual fee one)

Credit karma score is 763.

How do I further build my credit? Keep increasing my limits? Apply for a new card? And if so which one should I apply for.

I was also offered a 15k line of credit from BMO but never accepted as I didn’t need it. Would that have built my credit score if I took it and only used it once in a while for small purchases? 

Any advice appreciated thank you guys."
CRedit,"I need to rebuild credit but because of this I have a foreclosure and a bankruptcy.  Credit down to 542 Vantage and need to raise it to 570 for the SBA loan.

No car loans 
No real estate 
4 late payments in the last year- all September 19 due to hurricane delays"
CRedit,"Throwaway for this one.

**The Backstory:**

* I took out an auto loan with a 5-year term in June 2014.
* By May of 2018, disruptions in my income had led me to become seriously delinquent; ultimately, the account was closed &amp; charged off by the lender.
* At the time of the chargeoff, my balance was just over $5k. I thought the chargeoff meant I was off the hook for the balance.
* For whatever reason, this chargeoff does *not* appear on either Experian or Credit Karma anymore - in fact, they both list the account as paid in full with no late payments.
* Last status date on this account shows as January 2020 (per Experian).
* Earlier this month, I received a letter from the lender seeking repayment of the remaining $5k, offering me a chance to ""avoid the risk of possible repossession"".

**The Question:**

If I respond to this letter, could that cause:

* The delinquent account details to return to my report?
* The latest status date to be updated?
* A hit to my score?
* Any other negative consequences?

It's been 2 years since the account was closed, and I'd be surprised if they actually repossessed the vehicle now. At the same time, I don't want a repo on my report, and I don't like having this hanging over my head.

In the couple of years since this chargeoff, I've rebuilt my scores from the mid-500s to 700-ish.

Is there any way to resolve this account without taking a hit to my scores? I've come a long way in repairing them, I'd hate to lose that progress now."
CRedit,"He can delete bankruptcies, late payments, collections, pretty much anything bad off your report. People who do it see their scores jump 100's of points.

How is he doing this and it's it legal or safe?"
CRedit,"I received an alert a couple days ago from discover scorecard and Experian saying my credit dropped from 763 to 708. I’m having a hard time figuring out why such a credit drop would happen with very little change to my report.

In July my only credit card had a $288 balance (6%) of my credit limit, this was payed off immediately. It’s an amazon card that I use for every amazon purchase and always pay it off right after I use it. It looks like my credit report posted before my payment went through and removed the balance. I haven’t had any credit card use since that balance in mid July, so my September report shows 0% credit utilization and my score dropped 55 points.

I only have two loans on my report a $1600 student loan that I pay every month (even with the COVID-19 forbearance) and my mortgage that is also payed every month. I only have one hard inquiry from last year when I bought my house and one closed account from where my mortgage company sold to another company.

Can someone help my figure out why such a credit score drop happened?"
CRedit,"Hello All, first time poster

I've been trying to build my credit history and while reviewing my credit reports I noticed that the number of hard inquiries varies over the different reports I pull, further it looks like it is different than how I actually count it.

I have applied for four new credit cards in the past two years so I think this should be the accurate count. The reports show as follows:

myEquifiax: 0 in past two years

Mint: 1 in past two years

Chase: 3 in past two years

Why would these be showing up differently over these reports? How does it effect my credit score and ability to take out new lines of credit?"
CRedit,"Hey everyone, I need some help. I’m trying to pay down/pay off my debt to improve my credit. I’m currently paying my credit cards off (only 800, got it down to 300) but I’m left with about 4,000 total (an old apartment with an ex that I had no choice but to abandon and medical bills) 

I don’t have anyone in my life to teach me these things and I’m not getting much information from Google. I’ve been on my own since I was fairly young and have learned how to better financially care for myself and budget. Now that I’m in a better financial situation/better educated on how to spend/budget - I’d like to start this next step. So thank you to anyone with any advice. 

I do have Credit Karma, however it isn’t very helpful with who to contact about each individual debts. If it is - I may have over read/misread 


Thanks again


Edit: Equifax and TransUnion"
CRedit,So I’m an authorized user on two accounts that have 3-5 late payments on each which is unfortunately bad for my credit if I get removed as an authorized user from these two accounts will my credit go up or go down?
CRedit,I have a student loan that is deferred until October so it is current on my Credit report. Would it be better for building credit to to cancel the deferment and continue making payments?
CRedit,"Hi, will my credit score drop if I am removed as an authorized user?"
CRedit,Hey guys my credit score is around 710. I have had the Chase Freedom card for one year so far with a limit of $500. (It was my first credit card) I make around $86k before taxes. I want to build my credit up to reach the goal of acquiring my first investment property next year. What credit card should I get next?
CRedit,"Hey y’all, I just recently disputed the only high negative impact on my credit report, honestly with no intentions of it working, but like and behold I get an email saying it will be deleted from my report. My question is, will that give me a higher credit score, or will it have no effect on my score? I’m doing the self lender program and it’s been helping my score a ton. Still working on getting out of bad credit"
CRedit,"**Road to rebuild**

Hey guys for the last couple of months I’ve been wanting to rebuild my credit in efforts to sometime soon buy a home but I really have no clue how to repair. I wanted to see if someone can help me with a road map. I’ve pulled my credit report from all 3 bureaus and this is where I stand. Any and all help well be appreciated. Thank you guys so much

CRedit,"My credit score has been slowly improving these past two years. After a rough patch, which featured a few settlements rather than BK, I’ve climbed to nearly 700. My hope is to get back to home ownership.

I would like to boost my score with another card. However, it would mean another hard pull, of which I have 7, and a lower age of credit, which stands at about 7yrs 11 mths with MyFICO. In exchange, I hope to improve my debt to income ratio and transfer a balance. Is this wise?

Also, any suggestions on a card? Citi is great for transfers but I settled with them about 3 years ago. Perhaps another?"
CRedit,Most likely a mortgage from chase and a credit card from either chase or Amex.
CRedit,"I had a medical bill from last year that I forgot to pay, and it just got reported to the credit bureaus this month, so now I have an account in collections. It dropped my FICO score about 50 points. The problem is, I was planning on financing a used car next month- will my credit score continue to drop more next month from this collections account? Or is it just a one-time hit to your score? I’m trying to decide if I should secure a loan now in case my score drops more next month."
CRedit,So of course when I first applied for the refinance my score dipped a few points because of the hard inquiry. Well it just dipped again by 18 points after they showed my old account closed. Is this drop temporary? I'm happy because of my much better interest rate on my new loan but I feel like I'm paying a hefty price with this large score drop.
CRedit,"Im a third year college student and life is pretty much average. i have a discover student credit card, and I’ve been extremely responsible with it. i use a bout 4 percent of my limit i pay on time. my CS is 750 so i ask should i apply for the next best thing or just keep waiting till i start my career or what not. 


feel free to ask questions"
CRedit,"So I’ve been trying to bring my credit up since a bankruptcy in Aug 2011. I’ve been using CreditKarma, and my scores there show 601 and 627. Well, I saw on this site that I really need to check my Experian score because the CK scores are not really accurate. I checked Experian the other day, and it says that I have no credit history AT ALL!!  I haven’t opened any accounts since the bankruptcy, but I AM on my husband’s discover card with a 20+ year payment history. How can it show no credit history at all?  Is this a mistake?  Please help. Going to be moving and buying a house in 3 years, and I really need to get my score up.

Edit: Experian isn’t showing the Discover card at all, just all of my closed pre-bankruptcy accounts."
CRedit,A gym sent me to a collections agency. I couldn't log onto their portal to pay (login credentials were not working) BUT they wouldn't respond to me? So I couldn't pay my bill if I tried. How do I get this off my credit?
CRedit,"My wife and I make about $5000 a month combined after taxes. We have about $23,500 in total credit card charge offs and collections spread across 8 credit cards that all has a DOFD of 2015 which means they should all fall off from our credit reports by the end of 2022 and we should be passed the SOL (California/Texas). We kept gettin suggestions to just wait let them all fall off in 2 years.

Anyways, we have a car note of $14,000 (2018 honda civic with 15k miles, we brought it brand new 2 years ago and my wife only drives it to and from work ever since we bought it)

We have a savings of $14,500 and we have two kids while living under my inlaws house for the past 4 years rent free. Paid off $30,000 of my wife and I's combined student loans over the past 4 years so no other debts except the charge offs and collections.

We are thinking of just paying off our car note. Should we just pay it off or keep our savings.

I am unemployed with a VA disability of $1,600 a month which at this point seems untouchable since i had it since 2016. My wife has been working for 3 years and it seems stable, for now.

What do you guys think?"
CRedit,"Hi r/credit! After years of spotless credit, I've just discovered my FICO score has dropped by 200 points, into the high 500s, due to an unpaid $500 business expense from February. This was on a Chase business card that I had connected to autopay when I opened it; it's the only thing I ever used it for. I know I connected it to autopay because I connect all my cards to autopay--thus my good credit to date. I never received a letter from Chase, an email from Chase, or a phone call from Chase; they have all of that information from me and contact me regularly about other things. I also logged into my Chase account regularly and had 0 notifications from them. As soon as I found out that this charge was unpaid (tonight!) I paid it off in full (the amount in the linked account more than covered it).

This is definitely partially or even mostly my fault, but it seems at least partly on Chase too. So I guess what I'd love some advice on is:

1. What's my best approach to addressing this?
2. Who do I need to address it with? (The three credit score companies?)
3. Is it possible to receive some clemency based on my previously spotless record?
4. Now that the charge is paid off, how long would you expect this to take to recover? (My other card, with a separate bank, I use for almost everything and pay off in full every month, if that affects anything.)
5. Basically, how screwed am I here?

Thank you for any help you can give! I'm stressing, and I honestly just don't know enough about credit scores to know how to approach this."
CRedit,"Has anyone heard of New Coast Direct and My Jewelers Club to rebuild credit?

My friend has recommended getting both cards from so I can rebuild my credit. I looked at their sites but I wasn't really able to get much information from their sites like the APR and all the terms and conditions. From what I read you need to put up to 50% down then also pay the annual fee upfront then they report the credit line to the credit bureaus and your payments. They also claim you can have excellent credit or bad credit to apply. But I don't want to apply and get denied. Especially since I have chargeoff on my Experian and TransUnion report.

I already applied today for 2 secured cards. One with OpenSky and the other one is with First Progress which I'm okay with that. But I'm not too sure about New Coast Direct and My Jewelers Club. Or if I'll even get approved."
CRedit,"I’m currently trying to clean up my credit so I can get a mortgage by February 2021. With COVID-19 going on, I was told that the housing market may decline and the price of houses may go down. 

I currently have outstanding debt and 2 items in collections. I expect to pay all of that debt by October/November of this year. I was wondering if getting a prepaid card with a $200/$300 limit with help aide in boosting my credit and help show a history of on-time payments. Is this a smart move since February is about 6 months away?

Edit: I’m currently 23 years old in Houston, TX."
CRedit,"Hi guys,
I have used car loan (5 years) finishing up by end of the year. I was planning to buy a new used car within 6 months. I was wondering if I should get new loan first before paying off my old loan. It's not much. About $1000 remaining now. 

I have a question because I read that paying off the loan reduces the score. If I pay off and then try to get a loan for another car, I feel like I will not get a better interest rate because of less score. Can anyone clarify this? Thanks."
CRedit,"Can a bill that is being disputed be turned over to collections for nonpayment?  In other words, a creditor - in this case someone who provided services - claims that money is owed beyond what was already paid.  I am disputing this and believe I have paid in full.  My dispute has been made in writing.  Can the money they claim I owe them be turned over to collections?  Thank you."
CRedit,Is 28 hard pulls bad and what are the negative effects of this? And can my account be closed because of this
CRedit,"Four years ago  a new car I was financing  was impounded my police for a DUI. (Long story). I  knew the court case would take a while so I called the bank and told them where the car was and said I was  returning car (thinking they would take the car and sell at auction and charge me for the balance) 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing heard or done about this until  December 2019.  Then the  bank called me and told me I still had an outstanding balance of 1/5 what the original pay off was  for the car.  Thinking it was the balance after they sold off, I set up a payment plan. All good. The bank asked me if I needed the title. For what ? Turns out they had never picked up the car from impound. Long story short, I picked up the car and it was a little worse for wear but some compounding, new brakes and tires made her good as new. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks after I set up the payment plan my credit report showed the original loan as Closed with a balance of $0. (CK even told me nice job for paying off 100% of the loan).  Im making my payments as agreed for the settlement amount.  Nothing else shows up about this settlement amount, though.  No In collection , nothing. 

Does anyone know if this is normal ? Or should I expect a collection notation to show up at some point ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the advice"
CRedit,I have had a car payment for the last year plus. I've made all payments on time and never had an issue. Because of Corona I had no job and unkowingly missed 2 payments. My Fico score dropped 100 points. Should my car dealer have notified me? I feel that I've built up a reputation of making payments on time and that a mistep has caused me to fall hard. Is there a way to bounce back as well?
CRedit,"Looking for an apartment and it seems that EVERYONE wants to run my credit so I’d rather have it ran ahead of time and just show up with it. 


Help me out :("
CRedit,"I had a Victoria Secret credit card I had thought I paid off. It apparently hadn’t. A few months later they called me to collect the $35 payment. It ended up taking my FICO from Wells Fargo (is this reliable?) credit score down quite a bit.

I then cancelled my card from that store and one other (was this a mistake?) leaving me with one credit card that I purchase everything on and pay off monthly.

I’m not sure if cancelling the cards was the right move or if I should t pay off my remaining card every month? Any advise would be helpful! Credit is so confusing"
CRedit,"At the end of the year, i will be 30(f) and husband will be 29. We have never had a credit card or loans or any debt of sorts. 
But now with a son, his dream job of board game design and more stability, ive been looking around for some credit card options. Ive been wanting to set something up for a while but am so new to it all the technology can be intimidating. 
Any help appreciated not expected though. Even a basic ""do your research"" is cool😂"
CRedit,"I have an extended fraud alert on my Experian and TransUnion credit report. I'm in the process of removing them both but in the meantime, I'm getting secured cards to rebuild my credit. Normally when I apply for anything with a credit check they need to verify it was me that applied.

  
I specifically looked into the OpenSky card because there is no credit check and I can't get a secured card with a credit check since my credit is that bad. 

  
At any rate, I was wondering if my application would get held up because I have an extended fraud alert or if they would still extend credit to me without verifying it was me that applied? Would it also be the same deal with First Progress since they also don't do a credit check? 

  
I really need to get a secured card Bank of America just denied me for one of their secured cards because of a recent charge off on my Experian credit report. I paid it this month but the credit analyst I spoke to verify my Identity basically told me I should have waited for it to report that I settled the account and it was paid. To verify it was me that applied it took an hour. So I don't want to have to go through that again when I apply for OpenSky and First Progress."
CRedit,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone has any advice. I went to a dealership and they ran my credit without telling me. I only signed any form of paperwork (not even about credit) AFTER the credit check was already done and I was told I was ""approved"" for a loan. I was never verbally told that my credit was being run. I told them upfront I wanted to use the CUDL system through my credit union I already had. I looked at reviews and people had similar complaints. I reached out to the credit bureaus and then the company to try to get a letter saying this was an error. As you can guess they're saying I ""signed paperwork"" but the app was done online and I never touched the gentleman's computer. The reports were already run and I didn't want more on there from other banks, so I ended up with Capital One (not the bank they originally told me I had, TD Auto Finace) with an 8.15% APR (approved at bank for 5ish%). I've reached out to the BBB, credit bureaus, and company. Any advice on chances, next steps, etc? Different companies come up on different Bureaus and there's just so many inquiries it's difficult.

Thanks in advance :)

Hopefully this post is OK and acceptable."
CRedit,"Am married and want to qualify for a good mortgage. I know we need to improve credit, but not entirely sure what our scores are, plan to use the [myyfico.com](https://myyfico.com) service closer to when we are ready to purchase a home. Thinking 6ish months or so. He's working and I am not, I'm working with the assumption we both will need good credit in order to accomplish our goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have zero credit cards with one in collections in my name only from several years ago, car payment is in my name only with 2 late payments, and he has a few small things on his credit we are planning to take care of.  

&amp;#x200B;

Am I correct in believing that the fastest way to rebuild our credit is to resolve the collections and apply for 2 credit cards each? Make payments on time and obviously don't run up the bills, pay off entirely each bill cycle. Should we each get a card and one together for a total of 3 credit cards?

&amp;#x200B;

CRedit,"I want to finance a new MacBook Pro from Apple. Since I already have the Apple Card, it’ll let me do payments of ~$200 a month for 12 months. I’m wondering if I need to have available to me the amount of money it costs for the full price, or does it only matter as to what the payments are?"
CRedit,"I'm trying to rebuild my credit.   I just paid off all 4 of my debts in collections and I'm currently in repayment on one of my student loans to get me out of default.  And that only raised my score from 538 to 545
I have 3 loans currently.  The one student loan I'm getting out of default (about 17,000$), another student loan that isn't in default and I've been paying for a few years (about 3,500$), and the last one is my car loan which I only have 3 payments left before it's closed (about 750$).  
I also just applied and got approved for a secured card from capital one with a limit around 300$.  Someone told me the best way to raise the credit is to only use about 10% of my limit and pay that off every month.  Is that true? 
Just looking for any tips, tricks, and/or things I can do to help raise my credit.

CRedit,I have three files on my credit report that are paid off 100% but still have a balance showing. Does this affect my current credit rating?

CRedit,"I've spent the past few years successfully cleaning up my credit and made a ton of progress with my credit score going from about 550 to 730+.

But I have a medical collection from 3 years ago that I'm still dealing with. Recently this collection account was sold from one agency to another.

The new owner of the debt has started adding late payments every single month and I'm afraid this might destroy my credit if it goes on much longer. I want to deal with this the proper way and try to do a pay for delete and then everyone is happy. But I have some questions.

Is it legal for a collection agency to add late payments to a debt that is 3+ years old? Even if they have had no contact with me and I haven't agreed to make any payments or anything of the sort?

It looks like the new date on the account is 6/28/20, how can I tell if they've re-aged the account and if they have how do I start to deal with that?"
CRedit,"So, I used to see a dr. In 2016-2017 in 2019 I’m working on taking back control of my life I saw that I had 3 collections accounts from him and I thought they were suspicious because I had insurance at the time, and just generally he would deal with people who had mass health.  I’m thinking maybe there was a lapse in coverage who knows,  BUT this month he was indicted by the feds for money laundering, fraud, I feel like I might have been a victim of fraud?! Does anyone have advice, like step by step, or how to begin the process? or links to resources to despite these charges or ultimately get them removed.

CRedit,"Using an alt, I hope that's ok. 

I've been working on my credit for the last couple of years after tanking it through a bad marriage and divorce.

My current score is at 600 even, which is where it's been for about the last 18 months. I recently came in to a small amount of money, and can afford to either pay off the accounts in collection (about $900 total) or pay down my credit card debt to around the 20-25% utilization range.

The collections are all about halfway to the drop off point, and were accumulated when the ex decided to just quit working a week before rent was due.

My current credit mix is a couple of unsecured credit cards (no annual fees, PIF every month), 4 retail cards (carrying a balance), a car loan, and a personal loan from my credit union. Aside from the collections from four years ago, my payment history is perfect.

I would like to get my score up to the 700 area as I'd like to buy a new car next year, and a home in the next five years. I've looked at a couple of simulators, but they didn't really give good information, so here I am!

CRedit,"Update: T-Mobile confirmed they do not and will not report EIPs (unless they go to collections, of course).

One of the factors that always gets pointed out as a potential negative about my reports is that I have no recent installment loans.

I'm not looking to get a loan just to get it reported, but I do have an equipment installment plan with T-Mobile, not reported to any of the bureaus currently. **Has anyone had their EIPs reported to credit bureaus either from T-Mobile or other providers, and have they been reported as lines of credit or installment loans?**

CRedit,"Hi all,

About this time last year I had absolutely terrible credit. It's still pretty bad, but I'm in a much better spot. 

Per Experian (which I've noticed seems kinda inflated but I dunno) I was at **467 in Aug '19.**

**I'm at 615 now.**

I will admit I haven't been as aggressive in rebuilding my credit as I would have liked to have been, but lockdown has allowed me to really take time to sit down and actually plan this out.

I'll be applying for apartments in the Los Angeles area (with a roommate) around April of next year, so I'm trying to make my report look as less crappy as possible.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with these guys/advice on if I should pay these creditors, ask for a Pay for Delete etc. Here's what I'm working with:

* **$375** medical bill from a local ER. ***Collection Opened: Aug 2016***
* **$872** CapitalOne bill. Now with Portfolio Recovery. ***Collection Opened: Aug 2016***
* **$267** balance with CCS.  ***Collection Opened: April 2015***

While in lockdown, I've built up a healthy savings account so I have quite a bit of leverage to negotiate in paying a large percentage of these balances if needed. I understand, however, that may not be very beneficial at this point.

Thanks!"
CRedit,"Hi y’all! So I’m a little confused about a collection account I have in my credit history. I think it was originally opened in 2018 when I went to the doctors and the doctors office put in a completely wrong code which made my insurance not cover it. I originally disputed this with the doctor’s office and insurance and they wouldn’t do anything about it. (My friend went to the same place and the same thing happened to her and the nurse that saw us got fired for doing this). 

I disputed the debt with credit karma and it was eventually removed, but now it’s back again! My credit score dropped by 50 points on TransUnion, but weirdly it went up 9 points in Equifax (691). I’m bummed because I had managed to get my score back up after the initial collection account was reported and now it ruined my hard work. I don’t really know what to do about this. Can I dispute this again? Any help is highly appreciated!! 

Sorry for formatting I’m in mobile!"
CRedit,"So a few months ago a collections agency called me about something I knew I owed.  The were actually very nice for a change. Anyhow, I agreed to pay so much a month to pay it off. Am I correct is thinking it is too late for a pay for deletion chance?"
CRedit,"I have recently become obsessed with my credit score! Good problem to have right? Not so much when it won't seem to improve. 

I made some huge mistakes through my 20's/early 30's with drugs and alcohol but I'm 2 years sober(!) have been practicing good behaviors for a little over a year. Here's kind of a run down where I'm at:

* 725 with Experian (FICO), and 665 with both TransUnion and Equifax. (Vantage 3.0)
* $1750 in available credit spread out through 3 secured credit cards, and a Capital One that I recently got a credit limit increase on to $500. 
* Almost always keep them at a $0 balance but I use them frequently. 
* I have a brick and mortar checking account and an online bank checking account for autopays (it pays 3% APY so I think it's cool!) 
* Making payments @19.05% on a car, I bought that in June. 
* No other bills besides my cell phone provider and that is in my mom's name but is autopayed through my online checking account. 
* I live rent free in an apartment unit my parents own.  

I know I sound like an asshole for complaining about a good thing but fuck I mean, this time 2 years ago I was a worthless drunk but I'm sober now! Is there anything I can do to help my scores move along? They seem to increase a couple points here and there every so often but they have sort of leveled off. I'll like to get all my scores above 700 by the end of the year.

Fingerhut: I called them to make a payment arrangement. They agreed and I made a full payment (2 months worth), however they still reported me late despite the arrangement. 

Credit card: I called and got a deferral, but couldn’t make it. Got a second one and paid, but they reported me 60 days late by the time I made a payment.

and if i do start contacting them and settling all of these accounts, will that reset the 7 year clock and SOL?

I also have a loan from a credit union for $3,300 until 2024

All are in collections. I was paying off the bank loan until i hit hard times. Im working now but will be starting trade school next week so will be working less hours. But even so i think i can work on the bank loan.

My goal is to get a car/car loan. I figure that would be the smartest way to work on my credit instead of multiple, smaller purchases on credit cards. 
And hopefully have my credit in a favorable place by the time im done with school and working, lets say 10-12 months from now. And probably begin more schooling/training. 

I know its not as easy as that but this is an idea of where im at and my plans.

Im not sure if i could even open up credit anywhere or if it would benefit me at all with stuff in collections.

CRedit,"I am 27 and have a credit score in the mid 700s. I try to always pay my bills on time and keep a close eye on my score.

I recently applied for a mortgage to buy a house and the only thing blocking my approval was a debt on my credit report that I had no idea I had. 

It was under an apartment I had when I was 19 and when I left it, I was in good standing and paid in full. 

I called them and they said they have no record of a debt, they gave me their collections agency # so I could check with them. They have no record of me or the debt.

I then asked my mortgage guy who is was that  reported it to my credit and got their contact information and called them. They have no record of me or the debt. I asked them how that was possible if they are the ones who reported it. They said they didn’t and don’t know. 

I asked them to report it as paid in full and they said they couldn’t since it doesn’t exist in their system.

I googled them and they have a very large amount of complaints for false and inaccurate reporting. 

The apartment manager said if I need her to email anyone to let them know it’s not accurate, she is willing to do that but idk who. 

I’m not really sure where to go from here? Its like I’m chasing a ghost debt and it’s frustrating.

CRedit,"Hello!! 

A little bit of backstory, on June 30th I received an email from the Gold’s Gym location I signed up with that they would be closing &amp; TruFit Gym would be taking over. In the email, they provided me with the TruFit Gym General Manager’s email. Since signing up for Gold’s, I started working about 30 minutes away from where I live, and use the Golds in the city I work in. I’ve never used the gym I originally signed up with, even though it’s close to my house because I go after work. I signed up online so I’ve never even stepped foot in that gym. Upon receiving the email, I immediately emailed the GM at TruFit explaining this, explaining that I’ve already contacted the gym that I use and that they will be moving my home gym to their location so that I can continue to use it. I also asked if there was anything I needed to do to cancel the membership with TruFit &amp; was told “no you do not”. I’ve paid Golds Gym two times since this conversation. 

Today, TruFit is attempting to charge my card. I emailed the GM asking why, and called the billing department at TruFit. They are stating that my membership was never cancelled and if I want to cancel I have to go in and pay the remaining balance. I’ve never signed a contract with TruFit Gym, that original email from Golds was the only official document I received regarding the whole mess. I normally wouldn’t mind just following their procedures but this seems really slimy, especially since I contacted the GM and made it clear that I didn’t want a TruFit Membership. 

My question is: if I refuse to pay the balance, can this effect my credit? What do I do in the case that they send it to collections since I’ve never signed authorization for them to charge me or signed a membership contract with TruFit Gym? I already cancelled my card &amp; ordered a new one and my Gold’s Gym membership is still active and paid."

CRedit,"I have fairly decent credit. On transunion it’s 720 and equifax it’s 712. My payment history is at 100%, but my utilization across all accounts is 55%. My parents put me as an authorized user on a few accounts to help build my credit. They did this when I was like 16 or 17 so 10 years ago. 


The longest standing accounts I am affiliated with is my moms KOHLS card that was opened 22 years ago her discover card opened 14 years ago and an Exxon card that was opened about 30 years ago. They are at 88%,  77%  and 71% utilization respectively. 


I’m wondering if it’s worth it to remove myself as an authorized user from any (or all of these accounts). How do I weigh the pros and cons? Without these cards my longest standing account is only  6 years old total (but right now it’s showing my oldest account as 22 but my “average age history” as 7 years 7 months.

CRedit,"Have a low 616~619 on CK
Credit Card:  Secured Discover It (My first ""credit card"") 
So I posted a while ago about how my score has drastically been affected from high utilization, I got careless and stopped tracking my credit card use (66% approx utilization).
I've paid it off as soon as I could which was last month. I have no issues with not paying on time, in fact I check almost daily to see if I need to make payment. I've used my card a few times after that and made payments accordingly. I've just been a little hesitant to use my card though, last week I decided to stop until I see me score go up, and nothing has changed. Any reasons why? Is there anything else I need to do? On my discover app, it says last statement balance is 300 some, which I'm sure I paid because I cant make any other payments, and I could see that I paid it. Do I just need to wait it out?"
CRedit,"My FICO is north of 770 most of the time or higher.

Recently, I received an offer in the mail for a Personal loan, and also I feel like I was offered the chance to open a credit account for something I bought - a blender or something.  I don't need the credit, but I got to wondering if opening these term accounts, and then paying them off after 2-3 months would improve my score, as long as I leave all my other accounts the same? So, I am talking about just adding a few of these to what I already have, not substituting anything.  I guess I would have some inquiry hits, but if I did like 2 new accounts every 6 months for a year or two, would that increase my score or not?

CRedit,"I am in the process of rebuilding my credit. I had a charged-off account that I just settled today with Discover card but it has really ruined my Experian credit score.

My Experian FICO score 8 is 539 and currently, utilization is 28% since I had to buy a new laptop since my nephew broke my laptop. Its a BestBuy Citi card at 0% for like 12 months. Perfect payment history with no missed payments.  
My Equifax FICO Score 8 700 since the charge-off was not reporting and only my Citi card was reporting and its also at 28%. Perfect payment history with no missed payments.

My TransUnion FICO Score 8 is 566 has the charge-off reporting and also the city card reporting at 28%. Perfect payment history with no missed payments.

I plan on putting down like a $400 deposit. I also have a checking account with them. My total deposits account with them is like 3K and they can also see my other external accounts with Chase. My checking is about 2k then about 17K which is a 401k. So not sure if that matters to them.

I only have 1 inquiry which was for the credit line increase for my Citi card and then for an SBA loan for coronavirus aid that I got for my small business. The loan is still not reporting but it will be for just $1,000

CRedit,"I was in a high speed (90-100~ mph impact) car accident back in July 2015 caused by a reckless driver, and because the lawyer I hired waited around until the other driver's insurance company went into bankruptcy/insolvency, I was effectively hit by an uninsured driver and added $14,000 to my three USAA credit cards before I finished physical therapy.

My credit score at the time of the accident was 785, and something like 365 afterwards. When the dust settled, I opened a secured card and paid it faithfully for a couple of years, only to find that I was still hovering at about 400 on Vantage and even less with FICO until very recently. I was pretty disheartened, and when I got strapped for cash earlier this year, just decided to let it default so the secured amount would pay it off. I figured if I was still getting denied for the crappiest secured card offers and even cell phones and utilities after 4.5 years that there was no reason to even try until I have enough income to start with a clean slate. 

These three cards are now at about $21,000 after interest based on my calculations, but I just recently decided to look at Credit Karma for no particular reason and saw that they'd all dropped off the list of collection accounts. As it turns out, Texas has a four year statute of limitations which is 3 years less than I assumed, and this date apparently just passed. 

That said, I have some thinking to do now. Even though the debts can no longer be considered valid, credit reporting agencies will continue to hold them against me until 2023, as will USAA perhaps indefinitely. But my Vantage score is suddenly now 499 again with a FICO of 471, and I've only got about $3500 in debts hanging over my head between medical bills and petty loans that haven't yet expired. So I have options. But if I pay off every single last one of these and zero out the balance on a family member's card that lists me as an authorized user, Credit Karma says I'll only gain 125 points, and 624 is still 'bad credit' especially considering the FICO number is likely lower.

1) So, where do I go from here? Do I have any hope of a credit score that won't get me turned away by landlords and credit cards before 7 years is up? Also, a few side points:

2) Will I never be able to have another product like a credit card or checking account with USAA again unless I pay the full amount with interest? (Company specific, but a bunch of y'all are probably USAA cardholders. I'm afraid to even call them to ask for fear of reviving the legality of the debt.)

3) If I *don't* pay USAA, will the interest never stop accruing on their books? Will they expect $80,000 if I want to make things right with them in 10 years?

4) Should I pay off the others at all or fight to dispute each and every one as defective in some way? I know that full deletes used to restore more points and payoffs sometimes had no net benefit. Paying these off would also pretty much bankrupt me at the moment, but it could still be worth it.

Any additional input most certainly welcome."
CRedit,"I only have four credit cards that I have paid off 2 so only owe low balances.. 

Today I got an alert I have a charge off as of this morning. I looked at the account and it charged off in 2015. Don’t they only have 4 years to come after you?

Also, I disputed the debt to start off.... 

If they accept the debt dispute, will it clear off of my report? 

If it doesn’t get accepted, can I settle it and request to have it removed off my report ? I had this done once many years ago. I wrote a letter with the check I sent and asked for it to be removed. 

Would this be my next course of action? 

So lost on this !!"
CRedit,My parents made me an authorized user of one of their credit cards and I'm curious if closing it will negatively impact my credit score?
CRedit,"Recently, I saw an ad for an app called Cushion, that combs your accounts online for fees, surcharges, and service fees. Most reviews online mention that they take 25% of fees rebated, but it appears that their basic package is $36/year -  either way, a small price to pay if you accrue &gt;$36 in fees/year.

Does anyone else have experience with Cushion, or similar apps? What was your experience?"
CRedit,"Hello, I have a charge off account on my credit from 2016. It's from the orginal lender, but the original credit card company sold it to a collection company. I disputed it because I assumed it would be easy to get rid off since the original lender has no vested interest in it anymore, but I lost the dispute.

Mind you I have no collection from this account as I settled it with the debt buyer before they could every put a collection on my report. The only time this account appears on my report is from the original creditor.."
CRedit,She is looking into getting into building her credit. What do y’all recommend as one of the best self loans? Preferably something with a low minimum.
CRedit,"I purchased a car last week, and did financing through the dealership. Got a solid rate through Truist, so all is good.

However, today in the mail I got a letter from PNC Bank explaining why they turned me down. Presumably the dealership got turned down by PNC, then got me approved with Truist instead. That part is fine, but the PNC letter has me nervous.

The reason stated in the letter was ""Credit report indicates judgement(s), garnishment, attachment, foreclosure, lein(s), repossession or collection action."", and they said it was via Experian.  That's not good!

I couldn't imagine what they were talking about, as my credit is pretty solid (mid-700's), so I logged into my Experian account and there is nothing like that in there.

Further, the letter from PNC had my last name misspelled by a letter. It's a common misspelling, but wasn't on any of my car paperwork nor is it in my Experian account.

What's the likely explanation here? What's my best move to resolve it?"
CRedit,"I just took a look and my Equifax is showing my credit as falling because some old on time payment accounts fell off. Anyhow, I show 5 collection accounts that are 5 years old. Is it worth trying to negotiate these for removal? We plan on buying land and a manufactured home next year.  Thank you"
CRedit,I just realized my score and im just curious. What kind of benefits or things am I missing out on? I don't know much about all of this. Could someone kind of give me the short of it ? Thanks !
CRedit,"I was originally pre-approved about a few months back for an FHA loan on my first house. 

Credit score was ""good"" when my loan officer spoke to me about it, at least in the sense it was enough for a loan, probably about 660 at the time. Credit Karma had me a bit higher but I know they aren't accurate. 

However, I'm a clueless first time buyer and when paying my credit card this month online I accidentally clicked on the minimum payment and didnt catch until a days later. Of course now that I realize there is a credit check at closing, I freaked out and paid the whole balance like I intended to do. 

I called my CC company, explained the mistake and hoped they would help since my statement cycle was over and I carried a balance. Of course, they were no help and  now its reported I have a huge balance on a card with a fairly small limit. 

Again, I paid the card off a few days after I noticed the error but I'm closing on the house in a week and my new score won't drop until probably the 28th of the month and according to Credit Karma it caused a huge drop in my score. 

Am I screwed now for closing? 

I honestly have no idea what to do. My current rental is on borrowed time and has been a complete nightmare with a shady landlord, obnoxiously loud tenants etc.

Edit: My credit score from the lenders original pre-approval letter was something like 650-680. Not sure what system they use. I know credit karma is notoriously inaccurate but it did show a substantial drop after my new credit card statement hit with the balance.

Honestly, I'm not sure why my score is so low. I haven't been late on a credit card payment in the year I've had it. I've paid my car loan on time 40 months in a row. There's no current delinquencies other than a few late payments 3 years back. I just paid a few past debts prior to mortgage shopping after speaking to my first lender at the bank early this year."
CRedit,"I have a credit card charge off showing a balance of $1063, and a collection company for that account showing a balance of $1063. I disputed the original creditor saying balance was incorrect. Came back confirmed. 
Can both the original creditor and the collection company reflect a balance due of $1063? I thought the original must report $0 when the account is sold?"
CRedit,"My credit took a huge hit a couple years back when I closed my previous auto loan( never missed a payment for 5 years)and bought a new car. I’ve spent the last year trying to improve it and have gotten from the mid 500s to what is now a 618 on equifax and a 627 on trans union. (This is a vantage score. I realize credit karma is not the most accurate, but it’s been useful to monitor progress) I am trying to buy a home and hopefully investment property in the future so I need to get close to that 720 ideal.

Here is the breakdown; please let me know if I can include anything else. 

Chase auto loan, open since July 2018- 13k balance 
Capital one credit card with 500 balance, open since November.
Mission lane credit card with 500 balance, open since June.
Currently reporting an average of 12% credit utilization.
Self account with 300 “loan” balance, open since June 2019.
2 delinquent accounts;
Verizon in the amount of 1400. This had previously fallen off but a collection agency picked it up and it showed up on my report back in October. ( I tried disputing this and wasn’t successful)
A 3 year old utility bill for 500 that showed on my account in December.
I am only showing one missed payment which was in May on my auto loan, I’ve now set up auto pay.
Only showing one hard pull which was the capital one card.

I have called about the delinquent accounts and both would not provide a pay to delete so I’m not sure how to proceed there. Is there anything I can do to expedite this or am I looking at another year or so of slowly climbing up? 

Thank you!"
CRedit,"This is something I’ve disputed on Credit Karma and this is what it shows me but it’s still showing up on my report as I still owe it. Does that mean I still owe it or did they dispute and find out maybe I was wrong? Please someone help. Thanks.

CRedit,I want to buy a car and a home soon. How much will my credit go down right now if I bought a car from Carvana?
CRedit,"I just need to know whether or not I make my CC payments BEFORE the due date or ON the exact date. I have a secured card with OpenSky, trying to rebuild my credit, and I made a payment last month on the exact day. I’ve been going through some posts and some people are saying to pay the balance off as soon as possible BEFORE the due date. I need clarity please."
CRedit,"I had a debt from an old apartment go into collections back in 2015. It was for damage to the apartment; I told them I was refusing to pay for it because the damage was caused by my ex before she removed herself from the lease. I figured I'd just wait out the 7 years, as I'm not yet in a position where I need a good score.
However, last month I saw that the balance had been updated. The problem is that there was no actual change in the balance; it still shows the exact same amount. I opened a dispute, but that didn't go anywhere. I'm now worried; is the 7 year falloff date from the original collection date (March 2015, which it does still show on the account), or did this fake balance update allow them to force me to keep it another 7 years?"
CRedit,"I have a credit card that was closed in 2015.  It had a balance of $1800.  The account had been with a debt collector since then, but today I got a call from a new collector who wants $3000.   The original creditor says a payment was made on 2018.  How would I verify this?  My state has a 4 year statute of limitations on suing for credit card debt, so if I can prove that I didn't make a payment, I assume that means I can win any potential lawsuit?  Also, in case I do need to settle, any recommendations?  Should I offer a fraction of the original amount, or of the $3000?"
CRedit,"I’m about to be 19 and have no credit.

I pay for MyFICO, no score in any model on any of the three bureaus has me below 620. What’s going on here?

My bank card scores in MyFICO are 662/664/701. 

Where are they getting 579 from?"
CRedit,"I filed for bankruptcy back in 2008. I had an Old Navy account that I didn’t want to include in it, because there was a very small  balance, and I just wanted to keep it active. However, Old Navy decided to close my account a little after the bankruptcy was final.

I NEVER received any notices to pay-until today. I Received a notice from”Dynamic Recovery Solutions” giving options to pay. Has this happened to anyone else? It’s already over 10 years old and doesn’t even show up on my credit report! The notification states that the balance owed is $265 but they will settle $80. AND It literally states at the bottom of the page that because of the age of the debt, that I can’t be sued for it and that it won’t be reported to credit agencies. 

What should I do? Thanks!"
CRedit,"Potentially strange question. Does anyone know when a charge off status can be applied to a credit report? 

Is it on the date of the latest delinquency for example? Or when the account has finally been paid off? Or can the lender just mark your credit report with a charge off whenever they want as long as the account is super past due? This is for an old Amex card. Thank you!"

CRedit,"I guess a lawyer group is suing me for a debt of $800. I am a bit confused as I never received notice of anything other than them sending a letter saying there were going to sue me. I was able to look up the case though and it shows the ""served"" letters which I never got. I'm not really sure what to do, doesn't seem like a high enough debt to pay a lawyer to handle...I sent the lawyer group a letter a few days ago before I realized there was a court case asking them to settle for a fraction of the debt, but seeing how they spent $200 just to file this case it seems unlikely they would take that. Any advice?

I'm in CA. Are courts even open because of COVID? "
CRedit,"My husband has an excellent credit scor, mine is just good.  He was in a terrible accident some time ago, hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills over a 12 month period.  When the dust settled, after our insurance paid their portion, the hospital had passed on their tally of what we owed.  My husband mostly handled this with the financial office as he was in the building for physical therapy.  Im unsure of the exact dollar amount but we set up a payment plan for EVERYTHING.  We auto pay monthly.

A year later now im getting calls from a debt collector regarding 3 random invoices from that chunk of time amounting to $1,900.00.

I tried explaining the situation to them, the debt collector ended up hanging up on me after saying hes been in the biz 6 years &amp; has only seen 3 instances of a hospital taking back a debt.  I essentially told him there was no way I'd pay this to the debt collector, that the hospital agreed upon a payment plan &amp; ive never missed a payment.  

What can I do?"
CRedit,"I've just purchased a new bike through Klarna finance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm making monthly payments on it, however I like to put as much on my credit card as I can since I get rewards through it. Would be it a  and idea to pay the finance bill on the credit card, then pay that off?"
CRedit,"A few years ago, I had my parents add me to a credit card that they usually paid down regularly to help build my poor credit. Unfortunately, they ran into some difficult cash flow issues themselves and have had to use a much larger percentage of the available credit. They still pay regularly and on time, but the higher balance, which doesn't really affect them because they have other lines of credit not being used as heavily, has really put a dent in my credit score. When they were at about 30% utilization on that particular card, my score was at 670 and climbing, and supposedly would have climbed significantly when I paid off a small item in collections. That card is now at about 60% (approx 7k), and my score dropped to about 615 almost overnight. I'd like to have myself removed as a user if that would help, but I'm concerned because it shows me as having a history of almost 18yrs on it, and I don't have any other long term credit except for two student loans that were paid off two years ago. Should I have myself removed? If not, what are my other options?"
CRedit,"Hey there! So two years ago I went to an urgent care for severe back pain and ended up finding out both my kidneys were infected. I was literally there for 30 minutes, I peed in a cup and they took a tube of blood. Came back and gave me a prescription to take to Walmart to have filled which I paid out of pocket. This was April 2018. I am 100% sure of this because I worked at Walmart at the time that I went. I got fired from that job September 26, 2018.
Two collections showed up on my credit, one for 150$ and the other was 226$. Today I chatted with the agency in charge of this report to ask if they do pay for delete(I know the chances were slim, but no harm in asking right? They also told me pay for delete is illegal) and they said no. I then asked if they would settle the debt for a lower amount and they said that the place I went to does not allow that. Ok that’s fine so I asked for an itemized bill because I never received any bills in the mail, I was under the impression my state insurance had paid for them but found out that they took that insurance away and I did not get the notice until after I went to the visit. They accepted my state insurance cars at the urgent care and told me all was good otherwise I would’ve just left and had to suck it up.
So when I asked for the itemized bill she asked for which visit? I was confused because I have only went to that urgent care one(1) time ever in my life. She said it shows I visit twice, once in October and once in November 2018. I know 100% that these dates are incorrect since as I stated I worked at Walmart during the visit(got pointed for missing work due to going to urgent care so I have no doubt in my mind I have the dates wrong). I was wondering if I could get these thrown out or at least taken off my credit report due to the dates being wrong?"
CRedit,"5 years ago I walked into an ER, talked to someone, and then walked out. I was asked some questions and then left. No tests, no doctor, no nothing. While at the hospital I was told that since I didn't have insurance they could offer a type of insurance by signing off in some sort of info packet -- the coverage would get applied from compassionate-care or organizations that help people who don't have insurance.

Soon after I received an $800 bill to which I ignored for a while. As of this year, the debt was submitted to collection/charge-off which negatively impacted my credit when looking for loans, etc. It is the only negative mark on my report. So, after doing some research online I decided to call the creditors and have an itemized bill sent to my current address and see what was up.

The itemized bill says : ""EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT"" + ""MED SERV 10pm-8am 24 HR FAC""

Did I walk into the emergency room? Yes. I entered my SS number into a keypad, talked to reception and a nurse and then left. No services rendered, no doctor, nothing. And now this itemized bill basically doesn't show any services rendered or things to be billed for except... being a body in the main ER room?

Am I able to dispute this? Should I dispute by calling these creditors or just do it through Experian, TransUnion, etc? Any help would be very much appreciated!

Thanks y'all!"
CRedit,"I was looking at my Equifax (784) credit score on credit karma and I noticed a Derogatory mark under collections. It is for a $50 doctor office visit from January 2019. I called the office and they said I did pay the co-pay but a few weeks after my visit, they sent a bill for a procedure I had done which my insurance did not cover. I moved from that address by that time and never got the 2 letters they sent. I am in my 20s and want to find a way to get this mark off my credit report. Would it be best to pay it with the collection agency or the office themselves? Or should I dispute it?

I am quite nervous about the whole situation and never had a collection before.

Thanks."

No other debt or credit history
Fico guesstimate at 550

How quick do credit scores bounce up once the collections are reported as paid? Exploring asking for deletes with payment. 

I have 3-4 CCs I could add her as an authorized user. All of them get between 20-100 a month charged and entire balance is set to autopay every month. 1800, 4500, 12000, 6000 are the limits on these cards.  Card would remain in my possession but hoping this would help as well. 

Goal here is to help her get FICO up so she can obtain a decent car loan rate"
CRedit,"Before our divorce, my ex closed out Navy Fed Credit Card (orig credit limit $15,300) so we wouldn’t keep running it up. I was dumb and agreed to keep it in the divorce. I have paid it down some. Currently the balance is $10,751 APR 15.65% minimum payment: $220/mo. This is hurting my utilization as you could imagine and I’m trying to sort my finances out to eventually be a home owner again. I don’t think I’d be approved for a credit card with my score (596 Equifax, 622 Experian). I am working on paying off other debts, but my utilization is  146%. What should I do? Leave it be, try to apply for a personal loan, or some other option?"
CRedit,"Hello, if I paid the full amount multiple time in a month this means bank is going to increase automatically my credit limit?"
CRedit,"If I can, do I have to have a co-signer?"
CRedit,"Last time I check I have a FICO 9 741 ( maybe lower because I applied for the CF) after getting approved for it now, I now have two CC in my wallet 

My first CC: Navy Federal Credit Union cashback rewards 1.5% back on everything, limit is $5000

My second CC: Chase Freedom $500 credit limit

I usually only have 3-10% report monthly on my NFCC, that is roughly $150-$500

With my new CC if I do the same útil it only comes out to roughly $15-$50 reported each month

Does this hold to same weight as before if that makes sense, or let’s say I barely the CF, and have 10% on it and 20% on the NFCC is that bad
Basically how should I go about having two cards now which have completely different CL, and make sure I maximize my efforts in raising my CS"

They said they would pay for everything if I just agreed to the lease. I agreed and when the phones came I gave them to that person.

My oldest personal card will turn 1 year old in a week or so and I’ll apply in September probably. I have a chase college checking account that I have around $300 in there rn but I’m going to deposit over $700 more in there soon. My biggest concern is my 8 hard inquiries (3 show up on TU, 4 show up on equifax, but according to experian I have 8 total so maybe chase wouldn’t see them all depending on which bureau they pull)


Is there anything I can do to improve my chances for any of these cards? What are my odds for each?"
CRedit,"i disputed it but they came back as valid and now it says that on my credit history,

as they say no good deed... i applied for this card because they advertized that they would match donations to the extent of my purchase or something for xmas. the limit was so low that i never used it again. 

 the first 30 day was my fault the second was theirs. i closed the account and card in 2014 after they messed up my autopay.. anyway i closed it. 

how can i get this fixed ? when will it drop off ? just f\*\*\*d up"
CRedit,"I have about $10,000 in medical bills. I tried to apply for financial/medical but i apparently just barely made more $ from there minimum. So i couldnt get financial help. That was 2-3 years ago. I got a couple of bills, past due notices but nothing nothing to my new addresses where ive lived since what's on their records. 
So i wonder if they gave up. I mean there must be loads of un paid medical bills drowning the collector. If so, if i dispute it, they may not bother responding to the credit bureau and i get it wiped out.  Its a gamble. But it also states it will remain active until 2023. I could wait it out since attempting to pay off the debt may just as well take an equal amount of time.

I also have a debt with a credit union but that is a debt i can work with since its $3,300 and maybe i can ask and get that amount lowered a bit.

Best case scenario, i only have to work on my bank debt to get my credit back in order."

CRedit,"Hello. I recently applied to an apartment but I was told they couldn’t proceed (wasn’t denied outright) because of my credit. They couldn’t do a credit check on me as my name nor social security is associated with any credit. I’ve been building credit for about two years now so I had no idea what was up, until I came to conclusion that credit companies have been getting me and my twin sister mixed up. Our names are only one letter apart (no middle name), and our social security numbers are one number off. Credit companies have been assuming we are one person and thus putting all credit related things on me to her history. 

I told the apartment this and they told to me seek help from TransUnion. I was told I would have to mail my identification and it would take a minimum of five days. I’m hoping to move in this week as originally planned (this whole situation was brought up late last week) but I would need an update from Transunion before Friday or else my application is canceled. 

Would I just have to call them to see if there’s any update on verifying my info? I’m not sure what else is there to do. I’m assuming I have to tell which credit is mine and my sisters and dispute those charges."
CRedit,I often employ credit freezes with all 3 bureaus.  From time to time I remove those freezes.  I have a password for my.equifax.com -- I tried to log in to remove my freeze.  It said that the website was down.  Anyone else having this issue?

When I tried logging into my account this is the number that was provided to me. I tried looking it up on the internet and was told it goes to either a law office or a collections company. I'm hoping to talk to Discover directly though and I'm also hoping they haven't sold off my debt yet. Since I don't want a charge off and also a collections account on my credit."
CRedit,"Hello!

I've been doing a great job in paying off collections this year, subsequently improving my credit. I had a good experience with Portfolio Recovery Associates (surprisingly!) where I had 2 outstanding collections both negotiated down with ease, they gave me a verbal confirmation it would be deleted, I paid and the 2 items got deleted from the credit record.

Now I have 2 small new collections 1) Southwest Credit - June, 2020 T-Mobile $94 (offering $47 on mail and online) &amp; 2)  ERC - March 2020 $190 Spectrum Cable $190 (offering $165)

Both SWC and ERC state they do no delete ""we report the true and accurate statement so if it's paid in full it's paid in full, we do not delete.""

I want to improve my credit further and chances to apply for credit cards or loans sometime down the line this year would be great, what is your best advice from experience?

Thank You!

EDIT: if it's partial they report settled, ""true and accurate statement"" bs. I'll pay in full if that's best."

CRedit,"How should I approach dealing with this situation? I had two medical bills that I set up on payment arrangements with the medical group. I assumed the payments were coming out. I then receive a letter from a collections company. 

I call number for the hospital/doctor's offices and the person I speak with tells me they see in the notes where I ask for the payments to be set up. They said they can't explain why it didn't start and basically too bad. (Note, the person I spoke with about this, was the same exact person I spoke with to set up the arrangement but he said he wasn't and it was someone named Jerry instead of him, named Jason.) I ask to speak with someone in management. Im on hold for half an hour and disconnected. 

While on this call, he does tell me I have a $5.00 balance and would I like to pay it. I said of ""Of course."" Right. Last week, I get a collections letter for $5.00.

What do I do from here to deal with this in a successful manner?"
CRedit,"Hopefully you guys can add some insight...

I am currently at a 640 score. I had an old credit card that I forgot about and didn’t pay that went to charge-off for about 13 months. I paid it off in full in July 2019 and it’s closed. I have 5 credit cards now and everything is paid off in full; I have zero debt. No car loans, mortgages, etc. I use my cards and pay them off in full every month. The average age of my accounts is 3.5 years. I have $15,700 available credit between all of my cards. 

I have 4 late payments total (except for that old Wells Fargo card) on 2 different cards (both are one the same months/years). One in Feb 2018 when I deployed to the Middle East and was getting settled, and one in October 2019 after my divorce was getting finalized. 

Based on what I’m reading here, I won’t be able to do much about the charge-offs and all it’s going to is take some time to repair and build my credit back up. Anybody have any advice as to a way forward? Or just keep on doing what I’m doing?

Thank you guys!"

I see a lot about secured cards, but I currently have two cards I still have open and use from time to time.

I have a car loan that is very close to being paid off.

Would getting another loan for a car keep the credit diverse and used enough to keep my score growing? Or is there other loans I should consider taking out? Do investments affect credit at all?"

Loan:  8.74%, 36 months

Wondering if having two hard pulls on my credit report so close together will have long term significant impact?  Or will adding two loans to my credit report, and reducing my CC debt be more beneficial?"
CRedit,"How to build installment loan history + attain small Loans?

Please this is not a thread or seeking advice about Credit Cards or Credit Utilization or reaching higher FICO. I already have 9 credit cards and will get more and already reached 700 FICO pretty fast and keep util. Around 1-9%

My background is i have a successful 100% ontime payment past auto loan 5 years ago of last 2-3 years. That was my first installment loan ever.

Also, I just signed up for a Self Lender $27 a month 24 month duration credit builder installment loan.

I like installment loans for major purchases and debt reconsolidation of overtime its lower interest rates than credit cards over a multiple year timespan.

Also i enjoy installment loans because it helps the credit mix (10%) of FICO that ive been lacking.

I seek anyones help of i want to successfully overtime crawl then run on installment loans of get bigger and bigger ones over time.

CRedit,"I have a down payment assistance loan for my house. I became unemployed back in May of 2018 and fell behind on the payments. I was behind by about 10 months and then made catch up payments after I had found gainful employment. By my spreadsheet i should have been caught up and been reported as current starting in January of 2020 but am still being reported as late. I have called the creditor multiple times to discuss the reasoning and they have even admitted to issues on their side (crediting the large payments as a principal payment instead of towards the past due balance).  When i asked about the late payments reporting for this year they said that i needed to file challenges through the credit bureaus. I sent each bureau a report with my payments and highlighted payment history of the loan and my excel sheet to show the errors and the balance that the loan should be at, but they keep denying the challenge and saying the creditor proved that they are reporting accurate information. What should my next steps be?"
CRedit,"Recently had pavers installed and the contractor is refusing to complete the grout as was discussed.

CRedit,"I have a Credit score of 785 according to Mogo.  This is pretty good, on the scale from what I can work out.  I am financially secure, I manage my credit well but not obsessively.  I no longer have a car loan, I have tiny mortgage compared to my house value, I have a couple of LOCs that I pay the interest on time each month and that are not close to my total credit available and I pay off my credit card in full every month.  But Mogo says that my credit is ""better than 50% of Canadians"".  Given that the media would have you think that we have a crippling household credit crisis brewing in Canada, how can I only be doing better, credit-wise than half of my fellow Canadians?  Your average person is financially illiterate with a zero or lower net worth, but on this scale I'm average.  I don't much care about whether I'm 20%, 50% or 95% but I just want to understand how the country can be facing a dire debt situation if I'm average.

It's a Canadian score so neither FICO nor Vantage.  I don't think that the scoring model is particularly relevant here."
CRedit,"I use Credit Karma. When I was 18 my parents still controlled me financially. So, when I wasn’t doing good in college they made me drop out and move back home. Unfortunately, I had already signed a lease to move into an apartment and my dad co-signed it. I was only able to give the apartment a two week notice that I wouldn’t be moving in and needed to know options for getting out of my contract. I called and emailed but no one answered me. 

So, now I have a collections for over $6,000. Way out of what I can afford to pay off. My dad has great credit so he doesn’t care about the collections and he wants me to just ignore it. But now I can barely get my credit score above a 600 even with making on time payments for everything else. 

Today I was looking at the collections information and under remarks it said “affected by natural disaster”. Is this something I can dispute? I don’t know if my situation qualified as a natural disaster, but it did also happen after a hurricane so maybe that’s why it’s marked like that? 

If anyone can give me advice on what I should do or what steps I can take I would really appreciate it. Thank you!"

CRedit,"Howdy! 

I have been lurking on this sub for a long time and really appreciate everyone who contributes here. It has helped shape my thinking financially for the better along with a few other subs over the past 2-3 years

I have been actively working on improving my credit the last 5 months and it’s working, it’s becoming quite fun to see the score rise. 

I’m now moving onto tackling the blemishes on my credit report and one in particular I’m looking for advice with is below. 

It’s an old Wells Fargo “College Credit Card” I received when I was in school and did well with it but once I got into a little bit of a financial tight squeeze, I completely neglected it. Stupid but it is what it is and I’m looking correct it now. 

I just pulled my credit report this morning to start this process and find out what I need to address — here’s what it says under the Wells Fargo Credit Card entry... 

Potentially Negative 

Account Name: WF CRD SVC
Account Type: Credit Card 
Date Opened: 12/31/2008

Status: Account charged off. $500 written off. $500 past due as of July 2020. 

Status Updated: July 14, 2020

Balance: $500
Credit Limit: $700
Highest Balance: $925

On Record Until: Feb 2021


Questions:

1. Does it still look like Wells Fargo is holding the debt? Or was it sold to a collection agency?

2. The status is confusing to me. Can you help decipher that, can it be charged off, written off and still have a past due balance at the same time? 

3. On record until Feb 2021, does that mean it would fall of then? 

4. If Wells Fargo still holds the debt, what are the odds I could pay it off and reopen the account? Is it likely they would do that and would it be beneficial to my credit score more so then letting it fall off or just paying it off? 

5. Would love any info on maybe other angles or general thoughts on my situation I haven’t mentioned. 

Thank you for your help and if I left out any information that will help, please let me know."
CRedit,"I am a missionary and I will be in Papua New Guinea for the majority of 15-20 years (4 years in PNG and 1 year back in the USA on repeat). I have 2 cards. One is a chase freedom card that I have had for 2 years &amp; 10 months and the other is a cash rewards card with bank of america that I have had for probably six more months than the other card. I have a FICO score of 770. I know I can do a product change on the cash rewards card into a travel card that will allow for no foreign transaction fees which I intend to do. However, I do not have the same opportunity with my chase freedom card. I could switch to a travel card with chase, but it has an annual fee that I want to avoid and I don't think I will spend enough for it to be worth it. Is it best to keep the card and not use it for years at a time, or to cancel it all together?"
CRedit,I applied for a credit card that is managed by Elan. I spoke to the 1st person from Elan who told me I could count financial aid from grad school as income. So I applied with my financial aid included as income. Then I called someone in underwritting department at Elon and they said financial aid doesnt count. They said a human will review my application and decide if I get the card. If I get approved should I keep the card? Could I get in any trouble
CRedit,"So i recently got my first credit card (discover). When i got the card it had a print out of my credit score at 749. I made my first payment before it was due, $533.07 on a limit of $3,000. Why the fuck would my credit drop 100 Fico points when it seems like I’m doing everything right??"

So far I’ve signed up for “self” app. (It’s sole purpose is to build credit and payment history).

I’m also getting my mother to put me on one of her credit cards she uses to buy gas, groceries, anything she doesn’t have the money for before payday, etc. 

I’m curious what else I can do that would help my credit and payment history. Any advice would be awesome!"
CRedit,"I won't bore you with my life story - Bad Decisions/Toxic Relationships - HERE I AM. 29 with bad credit, but make great money. Just took care of too many people other than myself.

Here is my current breakdown of credit.

**Credit Scores:**

Equifax: 589

Transunion: 611

Experian: 625

**I have the following lines of credit/Credit cards open (or paid off):**

Navy Federal: $500 limit (No Late Payments)

Lending Club (Joint account): 24k (No Late Payments)

Capital One: $300 limit  (5 late Payments (30, 60, 90, 120+) - I moved and forgot I even had this card and the late fees and interest took me over and then I was late - I have since paid it all of, the account is in good standings and I called trying to submit a ""Goodwill Letter"" in hopes to get the late payments off they wouldn't do it over the phone and told me to mail in a letter, so I sent off a few today to different addresses.

Paid off Capital One auto loan.

Paid off 3 collections than stopped because I found out that does nothing for my credit scores.

**I have 4 collections:**

1 Verizon Bill from 5 years ago - $2100

3 Medical Bills - All together under $1,000 - thinking of just paying off.

Obviously, I am fully aware I am not ready to buy a house, but I spoke to a lender in order to help guide me into what I needed to do in order to buy a house, this is a goal for myself to teach my 10-year-old son.

**My lender told me to stop paying my collections, get 3 more credit cards, and only buy gas on them each month and pay them off, every month.**

I tried to get a secured card and couldn't even get approved, it was very discouraging. 

Does anyone else have advice from their journey?"
CRedit,Did anyone find anything just like self lender?
CRedit,"In about 2015 my wife had an excellent credit and being as a young married couple, we were blinded by how much credit lines companies approved her for. She added me as an authorized user on every single credit card and due to our carelessness on spending, we werent able to pay them back and ended up having about 9 credit cards that ended up charged off and we were able to pay/settle on 3 of them. So obviously both of my wife and I's credit took a hit and still feeling the negative impact of it. My wife now has about 490+ credit score and I am at 610.

We have 6 more charged off accounts and here's the Run down:

USAA - $8000
USAA - $8000
USAA - $700
TD Bank Target - $600
Midland Credit Management - $4500
Midland Credit Management - $1700
(about $23,500 total i just rounded up all the numbers)

All of these have a Date of First Delinquency (Year) of 2015 so i am expecting them to all fall off by late 2022

I think according to SOL for both California and Texas its only 4 years (We applied for all the credit cards while we lived in Texas and we moved to California in 2016) So im guessing we cant be sued for these amounts anymore?

Anyways, my question is, if you guys are in our situation and we plan on getting our own house within the next 5 years (my in laws willing to help, I am 32 years old, wife is 30 years old and we have 2 children. 

Should we just settle all of these remaining 6 charged off accounts for a fraction of the amount? or should we just let it all fall off by late 2022?

P.S. My inlaws are not letting us pay rent, we paid off all of our $30,000+ combined student loans and we only have $14k in our online savings left (no more student loans, our cars are in our inlaw's names)

My wife and I's combined annual income is about $68,040 after taxes (job and VA disability)

Any suggestions/advice/input would be greatly appreciated.

CRedit,"Hi everyone! 

I saw a comment awhile back from a post on someone asking how they got their collections account removed from their credit. This commenter pointed out a strategy of waiting until their collections agency sold their account to another agency. The person apparently had the full amount ready to pay but waited until the new agency sent them a letter notifying them of the change. Well, they paid the collections to the new agency within the 30 day grace period. However, the new agency didn't report the collections to the credit bureau because it was paid. The commenters then called the former agency and had their collections removed from their credit. I was wondering if this was possible to do? Are the collection agencies still able to report even if they provided a grace period and the debt was paid? Are the former agency allowed to keep their report in your credit even if they sold it? 

PS. I would like to note that I'm not very credit savvy so please explain it to me like I'm 5. Thank you!"
CRedit,"I have been working on repairing some things on my credit as my wife and I prepare to buy a house. I have some lates on Fedloan that happened because it was supposed to be on deferment at the time. It has been a few years and I’ve since paid my account in full. I was hoping to get a goodwill adjustment to have the lates removed, which I know is not a guarantee, but I was wondering if anyone has experience with Fedloan in particular, or adjustments in general. Is it a better idea to send them a letter, or is it possible to call and speak to someone directly. I’ve had a collection removed over the phone, but it was a local company and an obvious error, so I don’t know if that would work as well with Fedloan. Any advice or experience is welcome!

TLDR: looking for people with experience in goodwill adjustments with Fedloan. Is it possible over the phone, or better in a written letter?"
CRedit,"I’m 19 with about 7 months of credit history with a credit card i got at the beginning of the year. I’ve been looking at cars due to my transmission blowing out in my old car.

The dealer ended up giving me a couple options of doing 48 months with 16%, 60 months with 16% or 72 with 17%. Would it be a bad idea going through with the 60 months then possibly refinancing in maybe 6 months to a year?"

She can’t get another credit card to use for gas to slowly build up her credit because her credit is bad. 

She can’t get a mortgage because of her credit. 

Apartments are too expensive to rent. In my city a house goes for 700-800 whereas 2 br apartments are at 900 and above.

So we has a balance on our previous apartment, and because of the pandemic and problems of contacting them, our balance that wasn’t supposed to be escalated was brought to collections. To make the story short, our account manager promised that they wont report our account to credit and collections as long as we pay for it overtime. Then the pandemic started, we could not contact them on how to pay our balance, then suddenly we received something from collections and saw that our balance was transfered already. Fast forward, we had contacted our account manager on previous apartment, fixed the issue and she contacted the collection agency and the account was removed.

CRedit,"Home Loan Question(s)

I’m planning to buy a house in the year or so. The area I’m looking for is way cheaper than the closest “city” but still expensive. A new build starts off at 450k. My wife just finished school and hasn’t worked in the last two years we don’t except her to start working anytime soon due to Covid and her having to stay home with our kids due to school being shut down. I make 77k a year with a credit score between 640-690(depending on bureau and credit karma Vantage Score). I have a 20k downpayment ready also. I know I won’t get a big loan if I do it myself so my parents are willing to co-sign for us. Both of their incomes are approximately 90k together and have close to 800 credit score each. Will that help me secure a loan? Does there income and credit truly help me?

Also my DTI has gone from 30% to about 15%. Ive been working on my credit to get it down so by the time I really want to look my DTI is most likely going to be 10% because of my two cars that I have loans for."

Any advice on options would be greatly appreciated to help pass on."
CRedit,"A little backstory, a few years ago, thanks in part to my kid's dad, and of course my own bad decisions, I had a catastrophic credit disaster.  I had still been in rebuild status at that point, and all my hard work had just gone down the tubes, not to mention an eviction in which I still owe $4000, per a judgment in my local county courthouse.  I ended up falling back down to low 500's.

I had seriously considered filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy to rid myself of debt from my car loan and the eviction.  But I was even too broke to afford to file and pay an attorney.  In one way, I was lucky to have student loans that have been reporting as paid as agreed while in deferment status (not yet 6 months out of school).

Fast forward to present day, after giving up my previous car to the bank 3 years ago, I was able to finance another vehicle in February.  I also applied for and was approved for 2 credit cards in January/February, both credit building cards with low limits.  I pay them off every month.  Since then, I've been approved for 2 more cards and a Kohl's store card.  I don't plan on acquiring anymore credit cards.  I have a combined credit limit of $1800.00.  The car payment is on Auto pay, and I've been making student loan payments even though they are in emergency forbearance due to Covid 19.  

Credit Karma shows me at about 640 for both TransUnion and Equifax.  (I know CK isn't 100% accurate and the actual scores could be lower).  Credit Sesame has the same score.  I have credit score monitoring with one of my credit cards, which provides me with my Experian Score, and I'm at 643 (In May, I was at 590, so I've made good progress!).  I'm also signed up with Experian to receive all 3 scores per the FICO 8 model.  Those scores are quite a bit lower, two high 500's and TU is 603.  I'm still trying to learn about the different scoring models.  

I've been able to dispute a few negative items and get those removed, and the other negative items are anywhere between $70 and $900.  I only have 7 total collections between the 3 bureaus.  This is not including the $4000 eviction judgment.

Which brings me to my questions....to get these smaller items paid off, what is the best way to negotiate a settlement offer?  what is a fair offer?  20%, 50%?  

Also, has anyone used Experian Boost and had any significant results?  Is it worth my time?  I've tried to sign up, but it doesn't recognize my bank to link to, so this may not even be relevant.

And finally, is it possible to increase my score by 100 points in a year?  I'm hoping to buy a house using USDA financing next year once my lease is expired in June.  That will put me at 2 years positive rental history since my previous eviction.  Plus my car loan and 2 of the 5 cards will be at 1 year repayment history.   I'm really wanting new construction (single mom, don't want to deal with an older house and lots of repairs), so I'd like to start the approval process a little earlier than June.  According to their underwriting guidelines, they'll accept a low as 620, but I'll have to provide explanations for much of my past credit history.  640 they won't be as picky, and 680 is ideal.  By the time I buy, I'd like to be close to if not over the 700 mark. Is this too ambitious?"

My biggest conundrum is if I should open 1 or 2 more accounts. Sure, they will lower average age in the short term but increase it in the long term AND increase the number of accounts. So, what say you?"
CRedit,"So I have this account that I mistakenly believed belonged to one of two hospitals I owe money to. The reason why I thought so was because there is barely any information online about them. And the page I went to look them up at had about jobs in that profession beneath their profile. One of them was in the town I used to live. So I thought it was an obscure collection branch of the same local hospital. I just glanced at it, took that as confirmation of legitimacy, and moved on. Fast forward 2 years later and now I seriously want to fix my credit.
This company has 3 different collection agencies saying I owe them $505 and they keep updating the dates on the account. The company even started taking my state tax refunds. So now that my financial situation is stable I decided to start paying off my debt. Now my other debts are just Time Warner, Amazon, and Synchrony Bank. I seriously looked it up this time and realized that these medical bills are not my debt. I don't owe them at all! I've never heard of the company, never seen the office, and didn't even know that there was a town like that in my state. It's upstate, and I don't even have car to get there. I disputed it once in February on credit karma and TransUnion ruled against me. I'm not sure how to handle this. I mean, they are actually taking my taxes for something I don't owe. I ignored it all these years, assuming it was legit. Now I'm not sure how to handle this because of how long it has gone on. I know it's a minimum 4 years old account. They keep changing the ""date opened"" entry, so I'm not sure of the exact date the account was open.

I would just like to know when does the clock start? I do not know which one i go by when it comes to determining when the clock starts for Statute of Limitations. Are they still able to go after me to sue me to get a judgement based on the dates i've given?

I would greatly appreciate all the response.

PS: 
I live in California since 2016 but i started the credit card application in Texas in 2014.

Also, i believe i said something over the phone with a collection agency a few years ago im not sure probably 2017 or 2018 about willing to probably pay a charged off debt in the future. Could that really reset the SOL clock even just by saying something like that over the phone verbally?

And when does the ""7 year clock"" starts for the negative reports to drop off from the credit report?

Finally, even if the negative report gets removed after 7 years, can creditors keep reporting the unpaid debt to the credit bureaus which means they are going to have the negative reports pop up again on the credit report which in turn will start another 7 year of a negative item on the report? 

I hope you guys understood my questions.

Thank you!"
CRedit,What kind of an impact does a late payment falling off of your score have?  I'm about to have one come off next year and I'd like to see it raise my score.
CRedit,"I looked at my credit for the first time and found a derogatory mark: It's a claim for collection from 5 years ago that I have no knowledge off. The debt is stated as ""**Placed for collection**"".

I understand this should go away in 2 years. Unfortunately, I'm looking to get a mortgage before that. My credit is good, but this mark is preventing me from having an excellent one! So I have the following questions:

1. How do I find who holds the debt in case I want to pay?
2. Should I pay?  It's not a large amount... but I don't even know who I have to pay!? Also, I've seen online that if I pay it will **hurt my credit score for longer**! (6 years from date of payment). Is that true? That sounds dumb.
3. Any other recourse?
4. What would you do?

I'm looking at my Vantage score, but I don't think that matters here."
CRedit,"I first started building my credit in February, I got my first FICO score today. Decided to get an Apple Card because it seemed to have the easiest application process, as well as decent perks. Turns out I qualified for a $1000 credit line at 22% APR(ouch) - still very proud of myself though. Here’s to a long credit future ahead of me."
CRedit,Bought a car 8 months ago. All on time payments. Paid it off in July 27k and today my credit score dropped. Will it bounce back? Why would it drop after paying off a debt.

CRedit,"I bought a few things with my DiscoverIT card. There is rotating categories of 5% and everything else is supposed to be 1%. This month the 5% is PayPal and restaurant. Example of something I purchased was a tub of protein powder, using PayPal with my card as the payment source.



The transactions are posted, but I see no cash back. Does it not add any cash back until the end of the statement period? Does it give me cash back when I pay it off? Is there waiting period before you’re given the cash back?"
CRedit,"Need help regarding a collection apparently that a collection agency reached out to me around last week, I just had gotten a letter in the mail regarding that account today. I had a recording of the call but my stupid idiot deleted the call so I can't share it anymore. To make it brief I've explained to the agent I was sick and tired of dealing with the crappy Credit One bank and the collectors who keep picking up the account after every 6 months or so falsely reporting and threatening to open a collections that will hurt my credit after I've built it up for so long.

They claim that the account was opened under my name at an old address of mine which I owe them nearly 1.3K. The issue is that I never opened an account with Credit One Bank especially with their horrible reputation on top of which they claimed the account was opened in 2015 and then went to collections in 2017.

Back in 2015 I never authorized or gave permission to Credit One Bank to open an account under my name and should of never been possible in the first place as I was only 14/15. I don't recall what happened but I do remember it showing on my credit report where I disputed the accounts as a fraudulent account as it was illegal to have an account open since I wasn't of legal age and was unauthorized account that I never opened with them. As of now it's gone from my report which was last seen around like 2018? Of course now it's being brought up again.

What would you guys advise me to do at this point as it's ridiculously annoying dealing with this as it shouldn't of been opened in the first place as it was unauthorized account that I never opened and an illegal one as I wasn't even the legal age of 18. How do I respond to these crappy bank and the collectors?

CRedit,"Hi,

I am about to submit for pre-approval and just had a question regarding qualifying Income.

 I started a new job in November, so my 2019 tax return has a combination of my previous job and my current job's income. My new job is a significant pay increase, but I do not have a tax return filed yet with these new numbers and won't until my 2020 tax return is filed sometime in 2021. Will my entire new salary be used as qualifying income? Will it be some hybrid/average of my previous job and current job? I can provide an employment letter stating my compensation and pay stubs to support my new salary.

Thanks!"
CRedit,Do any of you guys have any idea of this is ledgit?
CRedit,"On my credit report it shows my name in 3 different variations 


For example :

First Last

First M Last

First Middle Lst (obviously misspelled)




Each variation has a unique name ID # associated 

This is their explanation:
“This information is reported to us by you, your creditors and/or other sources. Each source may report your information differently, which may result in variations of your name, address, Social Security number, etc. This is used for identification purposes only and does not factor into your Credit Score.”

So I’m aware it doesn’t matter regarding my credit but just made me curious because I recognized that specific misspelling of my last name as the same mistake a city court made years ago on my paperwork. As far as I know no other official identifying documents or anything anywhere for that matter has the same typo. The court mistake would have associated with my correct social however so I guess that’s how it came about here? 

Am I overthinking this? I didn’t know they pull court records and for that matter where else are they looking for info? This was a one time typo in a small city court, not even county or state. And if nothing else but to verify identity why go that deep when I’m sure there are many easier ways which were already done to find the other variations on my name?!

Edit:
Also wanted to ask if there’s a way I could verify that this is where they actually got that misspelling from? Perhaps with the name ID #’s somehow?"
CRedit,"Back in Summer 2018 , I had a derogatory from a bank that went into collections and in summer 2019 I hired a credit specialist to dispute and remove the derogatory. In december 2019, it was removed from my Equifax report, but not Transunion or Experian. I heard that if it's removed from one bureau, all others will follow suit. If that's the case, how long will the other credit bureaus remove the derogatory?"
CRedit,"Hello, hoping for some insight or advice here. I decided to check my Fico Score today through Experian whom I have an account with. Last I checked was a couple weeks ago where my score was 821. Today there was a 40 point drop that appears to have happened on the 4th. I have no new inquiries on my credit, no new debt, no new loans. I have tried calling Experian to find out what the reason was for the drop, they said they don't know anything about Fico scores and gave me a number to call for fico. I call and it is some woman in another country who sounded like she was just getting out of bed and told me I need to call about fico scores Monday through Friday. Anyways, I just checked my credit reports and everything seems fine, no new changes. Just trying to figure out why all of a sudden a 40 point drop for no apparent reason. Any advice or point me in the right direction of how I can figure it out, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
CRedit,"Had to move to GA because of my moms illness. I had a local nonprofit help me with all of my paperwork with banks, housing, and student loans. Everything went okay but in November my student loans reported 10 missed payments which is destroying my credit. My nonprofit gave me everything that they faxed to Navient with fax confirmation cover sheet. I have sent that to Navient, Department of Education, Filed complaints and still nothing. What can I do to get this missed payments removed?"
CRedit,"So I have multiple questions - I'm a 18 yr old student in Canada and I'm trying to up my credit and keep it healthy.

1) is my credit score good? I'm 18 and have a score of 680.

2)I checked my credit score for the first time a few days ago, and it's rather higher than I expected - considering I've never used a credit card or loan, so how DO they calculate my score?

3)other than getting a credit card, using it regularly and paying off my credit card bill, how do I up my credit? I have no use for a loan, line of credit or mortgage right now - I don't have enough money to buy a house, I'm getting tuition assistance from government (OSAP), and I'm not planning on buying a car soon. Is credit card the only way to improve my credit right now?

4) I noticed when looking at a chart that my credit suddenly jumped up from 550 to 680 in the past month - how is this? Could it be because I got a job, and if so, does having a job also improve credit?

CRedit,"Hey everyone. So I'm almost 20 and my scores according to Credit Karma are around 730 with my average account age at 9 months. 0% utilization and 100% payment history.

CRedit,"Hello Reddit,

Over the last couple of years I had taken out quite a few (good 4 - 5) high interest loans due to having poor credit. At first I took them out to cover finances, then I took some out to consolidate the loans I already had. 

As my situation began to improve, I was able to build up my credit and get approved with a Lending Club loan with a lower rate and consolidate all my personal loans into one. I have since then paid off that loan, including my credit cards, I have no more debt and I've raised my credit scores all above 730.

My issue is that I'm having trouble continuing to build my credit. 
My credit cards have all been approved at low limits. I've had capital one for about 5 years now and the highest limit they've allowed is $3,000. And I just recently got a Discover card a couple months ago with a limit of $1500.

I haven't been able to raise my credit limits or get a new credit card due to:

""Having too many loans taken out in a short period of time."" 

My payment history has been 100% for years now, all my debt has been paid off for quite some time now and I've paid off all my credit cards in full every month. 

I thought that would be a positive note on my credit report. No? And if not, how can I fix this. Is it possible to have those old loans removed from my history?

I have no other issues on my credit report.

Any help information is appreciated.

Thank you!

(I also would like to post this discussion in r/personalfinance). I hope that is okay, if not please feel free to remove a post. Thank you!"
CRedit,Long story short I had credit that was charged off to ERC and recently paid it off in full on July 15th. Given that it's now early August I assume that It would be on my credit report by now but it has not. Should I be contacting ERC about this or is this the normal wait time? I'm a bit unsure for this is my first time doing this.
CRedit,"I had a collection show up on my report out of nowhere that was not mine.  It belonged to my ex-husband and I was not on the account (cellular account) when it was closed because I was removed after the divorce, but I was on it originally as a secondary (able to make changes to the account - that sort of thing).  The account was never in my name and as far as I know, I wasn't ever supposed to be financially responsible for it.  The divorce was over 10 years ago but from what was on the report, it appears the account was closed about 5 years ago.

I disputed it through Transunion and Experian (both where it was reported - was not on Equifax).  Both bureaus removed it without issue which surprised me as I thought I was going to have to put up more of a fight.

My question is, this kind of blindsided me while beginning the home buying process.  I had been on top of my credit reports for months leading up to this and this showed up in June as a new debt.  I was so angry, although the details indicated that it would be removed in 2022 which is how I know that it's about 5 years old.  Is there any likelihood that this comes back?  If it's been removed via the dispute process, am I in the clear?  I really don't want to be surprised again in front of a lender - it was really embarrassing."
CRedit,"So i applied for the fredom unlimited card about an hour ago, was declined and had 2 new hard inquiries.

paypal credit: 500 (8 months)

balances: $124 on paypal credit, but i already paid 2 days ago, it’s just pending since paypal takes like 3-4 days.

I wasn’t aware that chase wants a year before i applied. But now i have 2 extra hard inquiries in my credit history and only 2 credit cards still. What do i do now? Dispute? Apply for more?"
CRedit,"Hello there.

My fiance (25) had one credit card and overcharged it and now it's in collections of $1800. Her credit is below 500.

I (24) tried college when I was 18 and ended up dropping out for family issues. I had taken out loans and was ignorant on the payments for them and now it's in collections and my credit is below 500.

We work full time and live on our own.

Currently we're renting and want to move with friends we trust to cut on bills and start making better financial choices, but everywhere we look we need 650 or higher.

We just got separately a secured credit card each hoping maybe we're heading the right way?

We don't really understand where to go from here, any help is appreciated, please."
CRedit,"5 years ago I bought a car and was paying off the loan. It was for $9,000. I definitely was way in over my head at the time and ended having the car repossessed. I still owed $4,998. The account was closed as ""charged off as bad debt.""

Should I try a pay for delete or just wait 2 years for it to drop off my report?"
CRedit,"Is anyone else fixated? This just began for me the past few months after years of covering my eyes. Now Ive plotted everything...from the 5 credit lines to checking CK daily ,to watching videos on youtube about credit, to checking all the posts here.  Is coronavirus making me crazy because I dont have other distractions while im home 24/7? Is anyone else obsessed with their scores like its the stock market?"
CRedit,"I got my first credit card about three years ago. Ever since I've made sure to pay everything on time. Only times I've ever missed a payment was when I enlisted in the military and couldn't access my phone in boot camp. Even then, my Transunion and Equifax scores are in the mid 700s. 

My Experian on the other hand is at a 609...and it seems as if it never moves.

I don't know how accurate the score simulator is, but it's telling me that If I keep paying my bills on time for the next 2 years I'll be a whopping 639. I know they are scored differently, but is this normal? Is there anything I can do about this that won't take me years?"
CRedit,"As  I search through my three credit reports line by line, I see  inconsistencies being reported about charged off and delinquent  accounts. Some of the inconsistencies are: Account Type, Date Opened,  and Date Reported.

Is this grounds  for the trade line to be deleted? I'm ignorant to the ways of the  credit world, but I am trying to repair my credit myself. What steps  should I take to try to get these accounts deleted if the creditor has  refused to delete them? What is the best way to dispute this?"
CRedit,"I got a call today from a collection agency about a 2 year old medical debt that I had no idea about because I moved right before the medical visit and they'd been trying to send me the bill to my wrong address for a long time. Today the agency called me trying to get my new address which I gave them. They said they'll be sending me more information in the mail. The collection amount is relatively small \~300 and definitely something I can pay off. 

I want to know what the best way to go about this is though so it doesn't go on my credit report. Is there anything I should do before paying off this debt? I've heard about debt validation letters and stuff, is that necessary? Also do I need to negotiate with them before paying off the debt to make sure it doesn't go on my report or will they automatically not report it as long as I pay the debt in full? Also if you think I have to negotiate, how would I go about getting proof that they agreed not to put it on my credit report?"
CRedit,"I have 2 cards. One is a chase freedom card that I have had for 2 years &amp; 10 months and the other is a cash rewards card with bank of america that I have had for probably six more months than the other card. I have a FICO score of 770. I know I can do a product change on the cash rewards card into a travel card that will allow for no foreign transaction fees which I intend to do. However, I do not have the same opportunity with my chase freedom card. I could switch to a travel card with chase, but it has an annual fee that I want to avoid and I don't think I will spend enough for it to be worth it. Is it best to keep the card and not use it for years at a time, or to cancel it all together?"
CRedit,"Ok so i don’t really know how to explain this but, my moms in debt and has been “borrowing” a lot of my money and it’s been getting sketchy.

I’ve been looking at my Credit Karma stuff and it has an account for a Bank and the open balance is 17,000$. That is not mine. I’m assuming she put me as an additional co-signer or something?

Is there anyway i get be detached from this so it doesn’t effect me?

CRedit,"My husband had his car repossessed 6 years ago (he was 21 and made some bad choices then). He said he’d handled everything and it wrecked his credit score for years. We finally got it together enough to buy a house. Today it a Charge Off from GM Financial pops up as an alert on his credit score. How is this happening 6 years later? He had no idea that he even owed anything more. I mean I’m sure he screwed up somehow, but this long after being repossessed. I’m just confused. Has anyone experienced a charge off this far down the line?"
CRedit,"I have a bunch of student loan accounts between private and federal student loans. I will be consolidating them in the next few months and I am wondering how they will show up on my credit report. Will all of the accounts I am consolidating report as one account and will the others be removing from my credit report? Also will this hurt my credit score since I will be consolidating around 7 accounts. 

My average age of accounts is 2 years (via credit karma)  between 5 credit cards, one I am an AU, all in good standing. My oldest accounts are 2 from 2016 and one would be in the consolidation."

CRedit," I'm  looking to buy a house in around 5 years (ideally somewhere in the  300-400k range). Currently I have a Vantage 3.0 score of 754, not sure what my FICO is. As far as  my credit history goes I had a loan for a motorcycle that's been payed  off, a credit card with a $1,000 limit that always gets fully payed off,  and a car loan with one year left. I'm worried about  maintaining/increasing my score once my car loan finishes up - from my  understanding once my loan is finished I should expect to see a drop since I will only have the one credit card. Any tips on maintaining my  score till I'm in a position to buy a house?

I  assume could just pickup another credit card or two to lessen the impact of the removal of my car loan. I've also thought  about trading in my car (7k owed trade in value of 13k) and picking up a  0% 60 month loan to keep an installment payment on my report - not  quite sure how much that would effect my credit but it would certainly  negatively effect my cashflow. Car trade in wouldn't necessarily be only  to maintain/increase credit as I have been looking to get something  better suited to my needs and seem to have found a  pretty good deal on the new car but I'm wondering how it would effect my  credit in the long run."

CRedit,"I am really new to this and would like help and info on credit repair as I am just beginning. 

My credit is at 579, I basically don’t have any established credit history. 

I opened a pre paid credit card in hopes of starting a history. $300 limit, only spending $30 a month. 

I have 5 medical collections and one collection from an old apartment and a charge off auto loan. 

The five medical collections are from when I had open heart. I am permanently disabled due to the heart condition. Total $1000

The apt collection is from 2016 and was successfully disputed off of my ex husbands acct but when I tried to take it off of mine I was denied. Total $900

The charge off auto loan that I co signed is recent Feb2020. I couldn’t pay with my limited income and my ex was not paying so it got repossessed in 2019. Total $10k 

Is there any debt forgiveness since I am disabled and on SSI? 

What would be the best plan to resolve my credit issues?

CRedit,"Can someone PLEASE explain to me how paying off a collection account (paid in full, NOT settled) and making the final payment on a loan (thus closing the account) would cause a score drop of 133 points??

No mortgage in our future anytime soon with these results! 😭😭"
CRedit,"Hi guys I've been here for a while and think I pretty much got a handle on how to ensure my finances won't be strained or worsened but I did struggle with life like all of us do. I was going through some financial difficulties back around 2016/2017 so I had a couple late payments then but also had only one from like last year too which was a mistake from autopay that didn't work. Then there's also one from crappy Fingerhut which was my mistake but thinking of closing that account at this point.   


Anyway besides all of that from what it seems like I've seen here is it possible to write a letter for them to remove those derogatory marks from my credit report? If so does anyone have any tips or an idea to give me on how to write such letter or do I call and ask them first regarding if they have such a program or if they're willing to forgive me for those past errors? Would really appreciate your tips guys."
CRedit,"I recently moved, and wanted to apply for an IKEA card. Their website prequalified me for a $3k limit, so I applied. I was denied, and in the rejection letter the information that they used to make their decision was from a CRA named ""SageStream"", and the reason for denial was that I had too many phone number changes.

To me, this is a red flag and seems inaccurate, I haven't changed my phone number in over 7 years.

I contacted the company with the intention to get a copy of my report, freeze my report with them, and to file a dispute. Unfortunately, the company will do nothing for me, unless I either send them a copy of my driver's license, or a copy of my passport or social security card and a canceled check or bank statement or W2 or utility bill.

I did a little bit of research on SageStream, they are owned by LifeLock. I have no history of doing business with SageStream or LifeLock, and I want no business with them. I contacted SageStream with my requests, and they confirmed that they will do nothing until I verify my identity by sending them copies of my identification. 

I refuse to do this. Every other CRA can verify my identity without me sending copies of my identification, why does SageStream require this?

I filed a complaint with the CFPB asking that they provide a copy of the report, freeze my account, and allow me to file a dispute without having to provide copies of my ID. SageStream replied basically saying that they will do nothing without me providing that, and the CFPB closed the complaint.

What are my next options? Do I really need to send them copies of my ID, passport, canceled checks, etc to do anything? It seems absolutely asinine that I need to send identifying information to a company whose business is selling identifying information to do anything with my account. Do they have the right under the FCRA to require me to submit this information? Why can they not verify me through other means like every other CRA does?"
CRedit,"Vantage score of 820 in March of 2020 and since COVID my score has jumped all over the place. There have been some changes to my report, but nothing I would say warrants such a drastic point fluctuation, except for #5 below, but even then that is a lot. 

This year:

1. Opened a new card in January. 

2. Paid off car loan/lease. 

3. March-June Unused store account randomly closed ($10k). 

4. March-June Unused store account randomly lowered to ($500). I manually closed it as it did not really impact my age of credit or total credit limit, store is likely bankrupt. 


5. July - Bought something at BestBuy on my BestBuy VISA. The purchase was for more than my credit limit, didn't even know (it went through). I was planning on paying a chunk of it off when I got the first bill. However I made the mistake of reporting my card lost (been lost for awhile) and it appears by doing that that the account was changed and the full balance immediately reported on my report at 121% utilization. My score dropped 67 points, the day before it was up 23 points. 


Any recommendations, suggestions, advice?

CRedit," I am thinking about getting a 3rd credit credit (BOA Cashback, Quicksilver) and it would probably be the Discover IT cashback but any other recommendations or suggestions ill take up to it being I'm taking an interest into credit cards but also wondering if there are any specific cards that I might be overlooking based on my credit score..But what would be the safezone of getting a new credit card and you plan on buying/refinancing a home in the future within 1-9months?

CRedit,"Hi friends,

So I just found out that every year between 2013 and 2017 when I went to CVS for my flu vaccine, there would be a $2-$4 copay that I didn't know about. If they ever sent me (or my parents, all of these are from high school/college) a bill for the amount I never got it, or my parents discarded it. I just got a bill from the Minute Clinic that was unrelated and saw years of pending payments associated with my name that were all sent to a collection agency, which I again never got any notification about. In total they amount to about $12, which I was just going to go ahead and pay along with my current bill. 

My question is, is it worth it in any way to contest it being sent to a collection agency? Without giving too many details I was a minor for most of the time period and on my parents' insurance for all of it. It's such a small amount I doubt it could have much effect on my credit score at this point, but just the term ""collection agency"" makes me a little jumpy. I figured I'd ask here just in case. If it's relevant my parents are also both passed now, so if this does anything to their credit scores I'm certain they do not mind."
CRedit,"I’m at a loss. I’ve been paying down my credit cards (two at zero balance), and brought my score up 40 points over the last year. Today a collection showed up on my report and brought my score down where it was a year ago. 
I’m trying really hard, and this just came out of nowhere. I filed a dispute, and I’m not even sure what it’s for really, but I’m thinking it may be from an old electrical bill from 6 years ago from my less responsible days (I was a complete mess). Should I go ahead and hire a legal firm that specializes in getting old debt off? 
I have some derogatory marks that are severely hurting me. 
Please don’t make me feel stupid, I’m super terrible with money."

Although without realizing it, I went way over my card utilization by 50 percent at the least, bringing my score down to a low 619. 
I'm a recent 'credit card' owner (Not really because it's just a secured discover it card) and I'd like some advice on how i could build it up other than just waiting for my balance to go down, how long it may take to recover my scores, and what other cards I should look into after I bring it all back up."
CRedit,"Hello everyone! First time poster and first time home buyer applying for a private conventional loan. My lender is unable to pull my credit from Equifax but has no issues with Transunion or Experian. The close of escrow date is 8/17/2020 so we’re getting down to the wire. I’m hoping to find some guidance or hear about anyone’s experience with Equifax specifically. 

This has been the process so far:

7/27: Found out from my loan officer that I need to “unfreeze” my credit with Equifax. Tried multiple times to register online. That day I called and followed the automated prompts multiple times, using multiple addresses, and ultimately found out that I needed to submit a cover letter, drivers license, and social security card via fax or mail to confirm my identity. Fax would take 3-5 days, mail would take 5-7 days. According to the customer service rep, after they received the fax, it would take an additional 5-7 days for me to receive a confirmation in the mail.

7/28: Faxed unfreeze request via UPS including the documents listed above that they required. 

7/31: Called Equifax to inquire if they had received my fax. Per the representative, the only way I could know if Equifax received the fax is if I receive a confirmation in the mail. Was told I could call back the next day.  

8/1: Called Equifax back again. Was told that again, nothing was appearing under my name or SSN. Was told to fax my documents again. 

8/2: Faxed my documents from my work. 

8/4: Called Equifax again. Nothing received on their end. 

8/6: Called Equifax again. Nothing received. Our loan officer’s assistant called saying to that my credit report is listed as a “possible fraud.” Was told to call a different Equifax number. Followed the same automated prompts with three different addresses. No accounts were found. THEN I talked to a Equifax representative who said that she could not tell me the name listed, but that my name was not correct according to her files. I have never once changed my name. 


As you can see, I’m really trying to get this sorted out. I’m also really concerned about Equifax’s ability to process my information in a timely manner, which might result in us losing out on this house, as far as we know. 

Please let me know if you have any experience in these matters or if you’ve had a success story unfreezing your credit with Equifax!"
CRedit,"And the whole pay for delete process is such a headache. The original creditor doesn’t want to lift a finger to get your negative off of your credit report or chexsystems Because largely they know that if it’s a new debt that they’ll be able to get close to 100%. The assigned collection agency may lie through their teeth and will say anything to get your banking details, Including reselling it off after they have been paid by you. If you come at them with a letter from a lawyer to try to put it in paper then you’ll often get a retaliatory reaction where in the file a lawsuit against you or it’ll have the effect of poking the bear for the death. Well it’s nice that the newer types of FICOs largely Disregard fully paid off accounts, for those of us that are trying to get into a mortgage they still use the FICO scores from back in the Stone Age. Does anyone have any thoughts on this pay for delete process that has given them some clarity?"
CRedit,"Hello all, I hope at least one of you out there can help me as I’m completely lost on what to do. 

April 2019 Quest Diagnostics (Bloodwork) bills the incorrect code and amount for bloodwork, so insurance does not cover it. They have billed the correct code many times in the past. 

June 2019 My parents (was 18, now 19) call Quest and tell them their mistake. Quest does nothing to fix it. 

Through the time between then and now, unbeknownst to me, Quest Diagnostics’s sent 3 notice letters for late payment and then they sent it to a collections agency. I found 5 collections letters in my dads office for the bill. ($250ish) I knew nothing of these warnings and now my credit score that I’ve worked hard on for a couple years (authorized user acct for years and now my own CC) on has dropped from 750 to 650... I am devastated by this because I am looking to invest in some rentals but it will be much harder to get financing now for a mistake I wasn’t even aware of. 

August 2020 I Called Quest Diagnostics’s (original creditor) and they have the June 2019 phone call on record but told me to call the collections agency now. 

I am lost on what to do. I don’t care about the $250 error charge at this point I just want my credit fixed even if I have to pay a BS $250. 

Do I ask for pay for erase from original creditor since it was their mistake? 
Do I ask the same from collections agency? 
Also saw something about a goodwill letter, but I don’t know much of anything about them. 

Any help is really really appreciated.

It’s a FICO score of 651 from Experian and discover."
CRedit,"Hi all

I remember searching high and low for information when this happened to me, so thought I would post my recent woes and results on the above if it helps somebody else.

In November 2019, ahead of COVID, I underwent an unplanned hardship and was unable to pay my Personal Gold Card American Express Charge Card.   I buried my head in the sand and ignored all their letters until March when it was going to go to court to speak to them.   I was (and still am) in a very good job and was regularly using my card between business travel and personal use to the tune of about xx,000 USD a month.  I was a card member in always good standing since 2014.

I dealt with the legal department who was not at all scary (in the end) and who actively worked with me to come up with a hardship plan for payments.  I paid 50pct first (thank you tax refund), and the rest in 4 payments.  I ended up paying a month early than planned for.  For this plan, they offered if I stuck to it that they would reinstate my card and membership reward points.

During the above period, before the debt management plan, my card was reported to credit agencies as Charged Off / Closed in January2020.    Upon the final payment above, I got a near immediate 30 point increase.

In addition, 30 days after the payment AMEX called me and reinstated my card in full.  It is limited to xx,000 spend per month.   I was so happy about this as this basically the same as what I had before the account was charged off.   I honestly expected it to be about 30% of my average monthly spend so getting 100% is a great result.

Now the final part is to see what credit reporting occurs for the new card number - to see if (a) the charge off changes further or remains and a new account appears for reporting, or (b) this replaces that charged off status to open (doubtful I am sure).

Either way with my other credit card balance (I went from 98% utilization to 2%) pay down I have managed since March to get my credit score from 588 to 720 again.   Albeit, I have a fear that the AMEX account above coming back may create a hit initially.....    I'll try to report back in 30 more days once I see what the credit reporting is to share that if helpful.

It was a horrible blip on my credit history and will no doubt cause me issues for the 7 odd years it remains there.   But my hope is as time goes on lenders will see it as less of an issue and the fact I paid and they reopened my account is the best outcome I could have hoped for."
CRedit,"Any help will be greatly appreciated. 

I have bad credit (per Experian).  It's a mix of me subscribing to the 1950's housewife model - no working outside the home, my name on nothing at all, and being ""taken care of"" - that, and just not being more proactive in my own finances as an adult.  Live and learn.  

I had small credit cards my ex allowed me to open, and then he would stop paying.  He would subsequently throw out any bills that came.  Banana Republic and VS went to collections, within the past three years.  Dealing with a lot in the last few years (illness, infidelity, divorce), I decided to have selective amnesia and pretend it didn't exist. And here I am. 

My credit score is right now 620.  It was 540 a year ago, and I got it up to 710. 

I do not own a home, my car lease is in my ex's name, and he wouldn't put my name on it, even though I pay for it (and have to pay for it, per the divorce decree).

I am embarrassed to admit I have three accounts in collections.  Two store, one doctor.

I owe $200 to a doctor who gave me B-12 shots, told me ""come in whenever, no charge"" - then charged me for eight ""office visits"" for shots I said I could give myself. He moved away, I have new medical insurance, and he just recently reported it to my Exquifax. I assume that is the dip from 710 to 620. 

I opened a secured credit card last spring and have been paying that off every month.  I just learned I should only be using 1/3 of that full amount, and I've been charging and paying half every month.  So there's that.

In one year I will need to get my own car and my own home. I will have the money for both, but not a reliable history to be lent the credit.

Pay for delete, I am reading, is an urban legend.  I am not sure what to do about the debts. Pay in full? Settle? Ignore? Also, is it worth it to ask someone close to me to add me as an authorized user on a credit card and then, of course, never use the card?

Really, any help would be appreciated.  I have so much of my life in order now and I can't pretend this doesn't exist anymore.  It is a hole I have fully dug myself into and I'm so disgusted with myself that I have not told a single sole until today.  TIA."
CRedit,"Cutoff for the next level of savings/loan% is at a 790 score, they pulled my credit today and I am sitting at a 786. We locked in our rate at 2.65%, but, if I can get my credit to a 790 “during the transaction” then I can qualify for 2.5%. 

We have 4-5 credit cards, but only 2 with money on them. Chase has $200 and Best Buy has around 4K. I don’t know what I can do to make sure I get the extra 4 points as quick as I can (I understand these can take time though). We have been paying the minimum payment on Best Buy and generally just pay off the chase amount when we use it. My thought was to keep making the min payment for Best Buy and paying off chase as soon as we use it in an attempt to raise credit over time, but, we can pay Best Buy off immediately without issues as well.

What are some things I can do to help get those missing points? Should I pay off my Best Buy card? Continue making minimum payments?"
CRedit,"Hello!

I am new to the US and I opened my first credit card on March 31, 2020.

I know the FICO score takes up to 6 months to generate but when will I be actually able to see it. I read on some threads that it actually takes into account the month that it was opened. With that in mind should I be seeing it in September? 

Any experience with this? We are waiting on this to generate in order to get a mortgage.

CRedit,"Called afni finally got a hold of them pertaining to a collection from at&amp;t that is 3yrs old for $437 after 3 emails and 6 calls. They finally responded to an email saying they received my inquiry and are investigating. 

Phone call - I asked if we could pay a smaller amount due to the current situation and he agreed and said the lowest that they're authorized ro accept on behalf of at&amp;t is $240.55 due to fair reporting and following their standard operating procedure. 

At that point I asked if we could do $190 and he said he cannot negotiate because they do not fully own the debt and are simply acting on behalf of at&amp;t to collect. So I told him that I contacted at&amp;t and they have no documentation that they can speak of - to now contact afni.

So I said I would agree to the $240 and asked if I can get it deleted from my report and he said the same line (fair credit reporting / SOP). After that he announced they'd do a 2 step process 1. paid in full then 2. removal from credit report. I agreed IF I could get in writing.

 I said I am not randomly sending cash for the hopes that what he said would happen. So I started to end the call and he asked why wasnt it paid back in jan etc. told him never received documentation of it. He then said it was sent on a certain date and I told him I have been at my residence for a decade and never received anything.

He then said he would be sending a deletion letter and I would receive it in 3-5 business days?

TL;DR

3 yr old collection, AFNI acquired in Jan. Never received their initial letter of acquiring it. I asked to pay at lower amount and receive deletion. Cannot do deletion but would do 2 steps (1-paid in full, 2-delete after it has reported) would not give in writing or email. Ending call asked why I didn't pay and said I have been here a decade never received it, they then said it would be deleted and letter sent in 3-5 business days?

Is this a method to delete then re-report it or something?"
CRedit,"Hello,

Like the title says I'm just a college student who has a couple of questions about credit. I'm getting different answers from different people whenever I ask some of these questions so Im not sure how things exactly work.

First question is that I currently have 3 credit cards and I usually use one for a month then I rotate to the others. I pay them off monthly on time and have never missed a payment. The reason why I have multiple cards is because of some of the promotions that come with opening up certain cards. My question is does having more credit cards and paying them off on time improve my credit?

My second question is can I check my credit score without hurting my credit. Some people have told me that it could hurt my credit doing so but I'm not too sure. If I could check my score without hurting my credit where would be the best place to do that ?

My third question is will paying my monthly minimum balance hurt my credit? I have been working and going to college at the same time and so far I've managed to make it into my last 2 semesters without having to take any loans out or anything. Issue is I don't know if I'm going to be able to  afford it now as classes in these last 2 semesters are going to be really expensive. I estimate that by the time I graduate I'll have like 9k that I have to pay back. What would happen if my credit limit is 9k and I use my card to pay that balance, then I end up paying the monthly minimum?

Thank you in advance"
CRedit,"Hi all. For the past several months, I've been tracking my credit score to try and improve it so as to improve my chances in being approved for an apartment/lease in the near future. However, I've noticed my score never seems to change in any way, hovering somewhere around the 670s.

For info:

\-I have 1 credit card through my bank with a credit limit of $5000. I have automatic payments set up and really only use the card for essentials, so the balance/payments are always well under the credit limit.

\-I have a pretty sizable amount of student debt, and am about to take on more for my graduate program (about \~$120K currently. Yes, it sucks). However, I've never missed or been late on a payment. My oldest of the loans were taken out in 2013, and 2 of those accounts have been closed since due to aggressive repayment the last year.

\-I do not have any other loans/debt.

Everyone I've talked to (friend and family who aren't super knowledgeable about credit specifically, but do have decent scores) has indicated my score SHOULD in theory be improving. Is there something else I should be doing to improve my score? Someone once suggested I look into getting a 2nd credit card - would this actually help? If so, is there a specific type of card I should be looking for?

Edit: I usually check my credit score through CreditKarma."
CRedit,"So I had an old auto lease that the finance company had never updated that I made the last payment.  There was no derogatory mark, but I was showing a balance that was being included against my utilization and a remark that I'm not recalling right now (wasn't negative and it was closed, but it somewhat indicated there was a balance outstanding).

My first dispute went nowhere.  They upheld the balance, which was ridiculous because I literally provided proof from the finance company saying I made the last payment.  Now, I redisputed and they zeroed the balance, but updated the comment to say ""Completed investigation of FCRA dispute - consumer disagrees.  Full termination/obligation satisfied.""

I agree with it being zero balance and only ever disputed having a balance outstanding, so do I get this removed or is this just fluff that won't matter if there's nothing negative about the account?"
CRedit,"Hello all!

My wife and I are approaching the 2 year anniversary of our banhkruptcy discharge date. My stomach is currently in KNOTS worrying about whether or not we will be approved for a mortgage after the 2 year waiting period. For any of you that have been through this before you'll know what I mean. 

Our credit scores are currently sitting between 645-655 and we've had no missed payments since bankruptcy. Our debt-to-income ratio is pretty good I feel, after including car payments, active student loan payments (others in deferment), which is all that is really on our reports. It puts us at about 23% DTI without considering our credit card debt which we intend to pay off prior to applying (it's not a lot), which should give our scores a bump too.

Eyeing houses in the Orlando Florida area around 185K, planning on having at least the 3.5% down required, possibly up to $20k depending on some circumstances. But still hoping an approval to come through for at least $185k-200k

My question to everyone who has been through it before, what was your experience like? Was it hard for you to get a mortgage? Was there anything additional that they needed from you? Is there a specific mortgage company that would be more forgiving than others?

Any and all advice would be appreciated. TIA

CRedit,"My mortgage recently changed lenders so I need to re-setup my automatic payments. I can barely make the $1556/no payment with $520 assistance from my husband while we are separated. This includes him paying the utilities as well. I work full time and the kids stay with me in the house. 

My gross income ranges from $29,640- 39,520 depending on total hours worked ($2280-3040/no in a 4wk month)

CRedit,"When applying for a refinance I learned that the credit score models being used were lower than my Fico 8. Because of this I was going to have to pay more in PMI than I originally thought. Which inspired me to see how much I could rehab my credit before my rate lock expired. Here’s a summary. 06/03/20 my credit was pulled for a refinance. On 6/30/20 it was pulled again after rehabbing. The things that changes between were being added as an authorized user to an account that was 19 years old in good standing and paying down my credit cards from 3% to &lt;1%. My Equifax/Fico Classic V5 went from 763 to 795. Experian/Fair, Isaac (Ver. 2) went from 758 to 761. Transunion/Fico Classic (04) went from 743 to 765. This saved me about $30 a month for the next 6 years ($2,160). Of course these results will vary widely."
CRedit,"Mods - I've noticed a huge amount of posts from people confused to high heaven why their score has changed, so I thought we might benefit from a sticky. I'm sure someone could come up with something more refined, but I threw this together as a starting point if it proves useful.

# Credit Score vs. Credit Report

First things first: your credit score is a number that is designed to indicate to a potential lender how risky of a borrower you are. *EVERYTHING* that is used to generate your credit score comes from your credit report. The scores are provided as a service to lenders to make it easier for them to determine your risk level, rather than trying to interpret and weigh everything on your report themselves.

Moral of the story: **if your score changed, something on your report changed. Start with your reports.**

# Credit Reports and Credit Bureaus

The 3 major credit bureaus (also sometimes referred to as consumer reporting agencies) are Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, and they each provide their own credit reports. The information on each might be different, because creditors don't always report to all three bureaus.

The FTC mandates you can get a free copy of all 3 of your credit reports (normally once per year, but because of COVID it's once per week through April 2021) from [https://www.annualcreditreport.com/](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). When your score changes, you can compare your most recent report to the previous to see what changed.

Moral of the story: **get your reports every week and save them as PDFs, so when there is a change, you can compare your reports and track it down (and also verify that it's valid!).**

# What to Look for

This isn't a definitive list of everything that would impact your score, but these are the usual suspects. Check for these first.

1. Adds/removals - added or removed accounts, collections, or public records will have an impact on your score. Inquiries will only impact your score, whether added or removed, if they are ""hard inquiries."" ""Soft inquiries"" will not impact your score.
2. Reported balances - did any go up or down? Down generally helps, up generally hurts (that's not written in stone, but applies in most cases, which is why it says generally).
3. Credit limits - did any go up or down? Up generally helps, down generally hurts.
4. Credit utilization - the percentage of your total available credit that you're using affects your scores; that applies to the utilization of individual accounts, as well as your total utilization across all accounts. Down generally helps, up generally hurts. if your total utilization stayed the same, but you moved everything onto one card and jacked it's utilization through the roof, that could bring your score down.
5. Late payments - any new late payments show up? any removed?
6. Account status - any changes here will likely have an impact, e.g., open to closed, on-time to late, pays as agreed to settled, 30 days late to 60 days late, etc.

Moral of the story: **a change to any field on your report can impact your score (except soft inquiries), but if you've found something in the above list, you've probably found the culprit(s).**

# Score Discrepancies

""My Credit Karma score is different than my Experian score!""

""My TransUnion score is 73 points different on Credit Sesame than through Discover!""

There are different models that can be used to calculate your score. Although there are dozens on the market, the most popular are FICO Score 8 and VantageScore 3.0.

Remembering that *EVERYTHING* used to generate your credit score comes from your credit report, you don't just need to know which scoring model was used to calculate your score, you need to know which report was used, e.g., VantageScore 3.0 based on your TransUnion report, or FICO Score 8 based on your Experian report.

If you're getting your score from somewhere and don't know why it differs from another source, check which model they're using, and which report. You can normally find this in the FAQs, but if not, google is your friend. All else fails, ask customer service.

If you have two scores using the same model and the same bureau's report, check when each last updated the information from the bureau--that could be the source of the discrepancy.

Moral of the story: **a credit score is based on the scoring model used and which report it was used on. Different scoring models on the same report can produce different scores, and the same model can produce different scores when run on different reports.**

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps!"

I tried another round of calls today and will hopefully have some luck tomorrow if I can get a pre-approval for one. We've been trying to avoid actually applying since it's a hard credit check. Would anyone have recommendations in which companies that may be willing to work with them? They have a gross income together of roughly $100K.

But the balance is on a Macy's American Express card that my mom has no memory of ever opening. We never received any bill statements or the card in our mail for that card. Which is strange because they still sent her the seasonal macy's coupons up until about last year-ish. I can't check the balance or do any confirmation online because Macy's basically froze all of her activity. 

I don't know the full story. I just know that all of this started when my mom bought an item which she later returned back in autumn of 2016 or 2017. Maybe the sales rep opened the account for her, I don't know. I vaguely remember helping her pay part of a Macy's balance through the phone after that. I was young and stupid at the time, so I didn't think much of it and just forgot about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do and how to proceed. The only thing I could find was this : [https://www.creditkarma.com/question/hello-i-tried-to-open-a-macys-account-once-and-was-not-approved-why-is-it-on-my-account-as-open](https://www.creditkarma.com/question/hello-i-tried-to-open-a-macys-account-once-and-was-not-approved-why-is-it-on-my-account-as-open)

""Go to [annualreport.com](https://annualreport.com) and get all 3 credit reports.  Look them over carefully and file a dispute on any errors with the company reporting said error.  They have to investigate and either verify or delete the error within 30 days.""

I'm pretty sure it's too late to do this, what should I do?

TL;DR

Debt collector called my mom (who doesn't understand English) about a Macy's account she doesn't know about. What should I do for her?"
CRedit,I had 3 cards i paid off one and closed it and one went into collection with cap1 not sold to a collection agency but closed maxed out (in payment plan) and i have a discover card for 6 years with perfect payment history and a 20k limit since the one card closed and the other in collection my score dropped from 730 to 598 (FICO) is there a way to raise my score and rebuild without opening an additional card ps i have nothing else on my credit report as i have no mortgage how long will it take to get above 640
CRedit,"I received a settlement offer and was wondering if it would be worth it. They are offering to delete their tradeline on my credit report from all 3 agencies in exchange for half the original debt owed, so I would pay $352 to the collection agency.

The deletion of the tradeline would be nice but I'm wondering if the original creditor's tradeline would remain. Any thoughts? Original debt is to Synchrony."
CRedit,"Hi everyone. I’m a freelancer making about $2k a month from the marketing industry. I have never established credit as I’ve never even owned a credit card. I buy everything in cash.

I have an opportunity to acquire a business that’s $20k and will make me my money back in 2-5 months. I will be able to run this business so easily as I am already extremely experienced in this industry.

With zero credit, and not enough capital to buy the business in full. How can I move forward? I have heard of people paying like $1,500 down payment to get a $20k business loan, with zero credit as long as you can prove the company will make the money back to pay off the loan. Any tips or info? Thanks!"
CRedit,"Hi, I have paid down my credit card considerably over the last two months.  However I recently became aware of Citi not reporting.  They have not reported since June.  Anyone else seeing by this?"
CRedit,"Hello everyone

The problem: basically I tried checking my score on creditkarma, and when i was filling out the little application one of the security questions said: ""Your credit file indicates you may have a home loan, opened in or around May 2016. Who is the credit provider for this account?"", and then it asked for the monthly payments. Well I indicated ""none of these"" and it gave me my scores(yay!). 

However, I am wondering is this just purely a security question just to throw people off, or is it possible someone opened a loan in my name/there's a mix-up in records? there is no way I can have a home loan. 

Context: I am an international student, arrived in USA 2017, got a checking/savings account 2016, got an on-campus job and SSN oct/nov 2018, got my first credit card - Discover it - nov/dec 2019. I have been in the US before, but never had any bank accounts. 

I just pulled my credit report from TransUnion, and the only account showing up is the Discovery. also info about another inquiry from some company in the report shows 0 for other type of inquiries in the last 7 years. I am checking this right?

I am also a bit worried, since other intl student have told me I had an unusually high credit score and credit limit when I first got my credit score back(people with approximately same incomes/allowances from families). I think it's simply because I only have 1 line, and don't really do much. However, I am not sure why my initial credit limit was higher than everyone. but it has got me worried now.

Only credit card I have: 

Discover it - nov/dec 2019

Credit limit - initially 1700 bumped to 2'700 this July

FICO Score around 760, TransUnion: around 745, Equifax around 730

I keep my balances at around 10%, never miss a payment, always pay in full"
CRedit,"I want to leave a really important nugget of advice for readers and members of this sub:

**Bankruptcy isn't bad, it isn't the end of the world, and there isn't a reason to feel ashamed because of it**!

Bankruptcy and credit shaming needs to stop. There's no reason for it! If you are up the your eyes in debt, can't make payments, and collections are hassling you, call up a bankruptcy attorney and discuss your options now!

There are many successful people who have had to declare bankruptcy. Love him or hate him, but Donald Trump did so multiple times (people continue to deride him because of this), but at the end of the day he still lives in his penthouse in Manhattan, owns expensive things, and still pisses everyone off. Trump doesn't care that he did so and neither should you!

It's not 1904 where your lender is your neighbor and your word is your honor. Faceless corporations in the 21st century don't care and neither should you. 

If your debt is unmanageable be it either medical, entrepreneurial, or otherwise don't saddle yourself with debt poverty! Be smart and talk to a bankruptcy attorney today. 

**End bankruptcy shaming now!**"
CRedit,"I decided to sign up for MyFICO last night, and I am so glad I did. After working on my credit for about a year, and wondering about Vantage (which nearly no creditor uses) I decided to go to the direct source. I really can't say enough good things about the site. Its easy to use and very user friendly. And the best part....CK had my TU at 675 and EQ at 723. The real deal MyFICO is TU 728 and EQ 779 (same as my EX). These are 53 and 56 points higher than CK reports. It gave me great results for a simulation of adding another card. I am over the moon happy. I was only going to get the 1 week free and have decided to keep it for a month after since that is the cycle I will be trying for CF or Amex. I recommend it highly."

Could this be a pyramid scheme? Or one to take credit card and financial info?"
CRedit,"Hey guys, I opened a Capital One Quicksilver credit card last year (June 2019) basically just to build my credit. I've noticed that my Transunion score reports as 781, but Equifax still shows 730. I started digging to find out why they were so vastly different and realized the Quicksilver is not reporting to Equifax. Is this normal? Is there anything I can do?"
CRedit,"So I owed a collection from 2014 for about $250. I am trying to clean up my collections, so I contacted them by phone on June 3, 2020, and said I wanted all correspondence in email. I also requested a debt verification letter to prove I owed it, and specifically requested it be sent in 30 business days. All they send me in that time is ""Different ways to pay your collection off."" 30 business days go by (so late July)I send certified letter and an email to tell them since they couldn't send me what I asked for, to delete the debt from my credit report since they didn't verify it. They then send me a letter July 30 saying that the debtor sold them the account in 2017, and provided my name and last ssn 4, but no additional documentation in that letter. Then, they sent separate correspondence saying they would take 150 to settle it. My question is, to whom should I escalate this? Can I escalate it? I am in Ohio, they are in Virginia. I don't need to have it resolved right this minute, but soon would be nice. From what I have read, they didn't do what they should have to prove its mine, but I just don't know if thats true or where I should go from here."
CRedit,I recently wanted to get my credit score back to a good place. While running my score I came across an account that I don't recognize. The account is with Citi and it happens to be a credit card. I never open or have been associated with Citi. My oldest account is BOA. After confirming with Citi no account is or has ever been open under my name. I'm left wondering if this is some sort of mistake. I guess my question is...are Citi and BOA related to each other? Does anyone have any suggestions?

This was over a year ago and i dont have mail to prove i was living somewhere else because its obviously in the trash or non-existent because i never had anything really in my name ever especially during the billing period. im willing to call the agency and try to work something out but i have no idea what to do or where to start. i have a 517 score and just paid my first bill in full for my credit card 3 days before due. can someone please help me figure this stuff out i have no family to go to, and cant afford a professional to help me.

CRedit,"Hi everyone! 

after a long while of saving money and penny pinching, my wife and I finally have enough to clear up a chunk of our debt. Wife’s credit cards have been paid off and paid off phones we were financing. So that frees up a lot of money in monthly bills and interest for us. 

Now onto my credit...  years back, I hit a really rough patch and had to charge my credit cards for everything and everything got sent to collections. Total about $5500 in collections at the moment. All but one account has been in collections for about 3 or more years. My question is, I’ve read a good amount about pay for delete and such, but I’ve also read that if the collections is older than 2-3 years, just wait the 7 years for it to completely fall off. So I’m asking, what’s the best way to rebuild my credit? My credit score is currently at 520 and it’s a bit depressing that I wasn’t able to assist in purchasing a home or car at the moment. So I really want to make a plan and stick to it. We paid off all our other debt minus everything in collections. I do have about $35000 in student loans, and those come out to $360 a month in payments but that has been manageable. 

So what is the best plan/options moving forward? Secured credit cards to build credit? Would my wife adding me as a user on her credit cards help? I really hate that I was stupid with my credit when I was young, but I’m feeling really positive about this moving forward especially after reading on this sub and others."
CRedit,"Hello All,

Seeking some feedback/guidance. My lease for my apartment is up in April, about 8 months from now. I have been looking into getting my family into a home for a while now, but wasn't serious about working towards it until now.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the factors I'm working with:

\- Credit Score around 600. (603 Transunion, 606 Equifax per Credit Karma)

\-One collections item on credit report (\~$650, opened 707/2017, not 100% what it's for, considering disputing but concerned about triggering a lawsuit).

\-Student loans (\~$15k) in good standing thanks to federal forbearance, but were delinquent previously. Plan is to try and qualify for reduced payments when the forbearance is lifted, but unsure if this is reported negatively to credit bureaus.

\-No current credit cards.

\-Current savings = $1k, planning on putting majority of whatever comes from next round of stimulus into it. Assuming it's similar to the last one, that we're aiming at adding \~$2400 to savings.

\~Working full-time, salary \~$55k

\-X-factors: I'll likely get \~1,500 - $2k in Q1 of 2010 and expect to get a tax refund of more than $2k next year.

\-One factor I can't quite nail down is the actual home cost, I'm unsure how my credit situation would affect finance rates which would have a play in how much home we can afford. I currently pay \~$1350 in rent and haven't ever been late, so I'm comfortable with something around that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan to raise the score moderately quickly is to do a credit builder loan, dispute/negotiate the one collections item, and stay on top of the student loans. If we can manage not to touch the savings, then we'll have a bit to put towards housing, it wouldn't be 20% but we'd try to go a route that could work with that. A non-listed X-factor is various family members commitment to help with closing costs/down payments, but I know that's not a guarantee so I'm nor factoring.

Is this sound/doable?"
CRedit,My husband's score is currently 611. We're hoping to purchase a home by august of 2021. He has 3 negative collections on his report totalling around $2300 but he doesn't have any credit history. what would be the best way to go about raising his credit to be approved for a house loan?
CRedit,"Hey guys so I have a car repossession reported back in 2015 for an amount of $7,857 by partners FEDERAL CREDIT UNION. It looks like they sold the account to Credit collection services. I tried to dispute the account with no success which is kind of obvious, well  2 days ago they finally contacted me and said “hey you’ve been trying to dispute a repo and we want to help you resolve the matter, would you be willing to pay 5,000 and we will mark as paid in full” I told them sorry I can’t afford that... the most I can pay is 2,000 and they said we’ll call you back tomorrow. 24 hours later they call me and say they will accept 2,000 and I said pay for delete? And they said no, but you can dispute after paying the balance and we will not respond to dispute so more than likely it will fall off. 

They are willing to mark as paid in full. 

What should I do? 
Are they lying? 

Or are they finally calling me cause I signed up for CS360? 

Idk what to do?"
CRedit,"So I’ve been slowly working on rebuilding my credit and paying off old debts/collections. I’ve paid all of them off one by one (paid in full, not settled except on one). Every time I paid one off and it was removed, my score would jump up 10-25 points. Came down to my very last debt, which was only $116 from T-Mobile from 4 years ago. I paid in full, and today it finally was removed from all 3 reports but I’m very confused on what happened. Experian went up 5, transunion went down 69 and equifax went down 46. This is so defeating and honestly makes me want to give up."
CRedit,"\-Vantage score

Why did my credit score suddenly drop 59 points?

Zero accounts open  
Zero recent closed accounts  
Zero hard inquiries  
Literally nothing that would have affected it whatsoever.

Chap 7 bankruptcy discharge March of last year."
CRedit,"Equifax is reporting an inaccurate collection on my report. I went directly through the data furnisher, who requested the account be deleted on July 23rd, and sent me a confirmation in writing.

Equifax has still not removed the inaccurate account as of today. I cannot dispute the account because it is marked as ""under investigation from a previous dispute,"" and I cannot check the status of the dispute, because there are none listed in the dispute center.

Once notified by the data furnisher that the information is inaccurate, how long does Equifax have to update the information? I couldn't find the details on that in the FCRA.

Thanks!"
CRedit,Can all collection agencies provide a deletion letter for the credit agencies if you ask? I'm willing to pay the amount they want and not negotiate it lower but I want a deletion letter. The collection account outstanding for over 5 years. Of course in hindsight I should have done it back then and it would be dropping off soon.
CRedit,"Does Credit Karma show everything you have outstanding, Debt and collection accounts?"
CRedit,"We are looking to buy a home in the next year and need to get my husband's score up. He currently only has one actual card connected to his credit, and is just an authorized user on my cards. I didn't realize he wouldn't be building credit being an authorized user.

My question is: is there a way to turn his authorized usage into something that will build him credit? If yes, will that do more harm than good at this point? The card he is an authorized user on he actually uses quite a bit for gas. My loan officer recommended removing him from all authorized cards that are under my name.

Right now he currently has 1 other credit card, and both our cars-- all of which are in my name also. The 1 credit card was high credit usage and I brought it down to $10 at the recommendation of the loan officer. Would it be better to leave status quo for now?"
CRedit,"One place says $0.00 current amount due then next payment due by August 17th then another page says next payment due August 17 minimum payment $48.00

What do I pay? When and how much..?

Should I just set up auto pay?"
CRedit,"I have a credit card with a company that recently closed all of their stores, and are now defunct. I’m getting nervous because I had this on auto pay and it hasn’t charged me. I cannot access the portal where I made payments before, I get the “Safari cannot open the page because the server cannot be found.” error. I only owe $130 but I can’t seem to find a way to pay this even when googling. Has anyone ever had something like this happen? How do I prevent this from going into collections?"
CRedit,Hey all! I'm new to this so sorry if this has already been asked. I'm friends with a realtor and she posted about how we should leave $3 on credit card balance due to new FICO algorithm. Can anyone give insight onto if I should actually do this? I've always been told to pay off balance in full before the due date. Thanks for any help you can offer.
CRedit,"Hey, so I’m 24 and have BMO for an auto loan. According to credit karma I have a 734 score. Anyway, I’ve had bmo for 3 years for my pickup I bought. I can’t login online, don’t have time to sit on the phone and wait for 27 minutes to pay over the phone, and can’t set up autopay over the phone either. (Until yesterday apparently)? So they would call me after about a week past the due date, I would pay for that month, and then I would post date my next payment. I liked this method because I could get 2 payments done in 5 minutes. And then the cycle would come again 2 months after.. repeat. I’ve done this for 3 years now but this month I never got a call. I figure, I must’ve post dated this month? And went on with my days until today. I figured I better check just in case. No, it was not post dated. I did not receive any sort of calls, emails, or anything. Which YES people - I know it is my responsibility!! But I’ve become used to the call a week after the due date, make my 2 payments, viola. 

Talked to bmo, paid my July and August payment today, and have autopay FINALLLLLY set up over the phone and ready for September. They said they didn’t know if it would be marked late. Given i paid it on the 30th day. (Due date is the 4th of every month) It needs to be “posted and funds available today” for it to not be late? But she said it probably won’t be posted until tomorrow and it will most likely be reported to the credit bureau. 

I’m torn with this. It is ultimately my fault and I will never rely on a phone call for a reminder again. I’ve rebuilt my credit after 2 years of idiocy after high school with a credit card. I have had 6 missed payments in my lifetime and haven’t missed one for 4 years.

What will my credit drop to if (and probably will) my missed payment is reported? 

Also, any tips to help my score as I prepare for this hit? Would paying a few thousand off of the loan today help at all?

Edit: I have zero credit card debt, I currently owe 11k in the auto, and 12k in student loans"
CRedit,"Whats up reddit. I am in the process of rebuilding my credit. Three years back my father had a stroke and everything went wrong after that, but today is a better day. My credit was 534 and I been grinding for the past year now I stand at trans 637, equifax 649, Experian 635. I been paying everything on time. I have no credit history in the last 3 years at all. I own a house, no car payments as everything is paid off. However, I do have a student loan for 3k and a collection for 2k that I am paying. My question is, should I apply for a secure card? Or should I just keep on paying what I owe? Any advise is greatly appreciated. Thanks"
CRedit,"Hi, Two part question on different topics. I have pretty good credit in the 785 range. A few questions...

I have some store cards with zero balances that are accounts 3-5 years old and I don’t use them. Should I leave these open or close the accounts? I think closing them will look like I have less credit and make my score go down. I have other older credit cards that are at least 15 years old and I would not close them. Just the newer store card ones. 

Also, 2nd unrelated question: I carry a balance on some of my regular visa &amp; mastercards (non-store cards) but not heavy credit utilization, less than 1/4 of the card’s maximum balance is utilized. I pay extra on these credit card bills and I’m reducing my overall debt to get all paid off eventually. I called some of these creditors with higher APRs, and they said they cannot lower my interest rate, since it’s the prime rate + my score that calculates my interest rate. BUT I have this older Barclay (formerly Juniper) card with a crazy low APR of like 7% and then other cards like Citibank or Capital One and they will not budge on the APR lowering request. These cards are like 18% APR upwards to 21% APR. I’m definitely paying the cards with higher APR down first, I always pay early or on time, always pay more then my minimum, adding at least $10-$20 on to minimum payment, and have an overall good standing. How can I play this game better and get lowered APRs? Why such disparity of APR between different card issuers? 
Are balance transfers the best way to do this or continue to ask the credit card companies to lower my interest rates? I’m familiar with the debt snowball method, but really want to bring down interest costs too."
CRedit,"As the title says, I’ve tried 4 phone numbers and all of them after entering my SSN take me to the same voice message with only the option to put an alert on my account or report fraud. Is there a way to talk to a real person?"
CRedit,"Basically he had to go through some routine check for his account, a secure verification and me as well and my aunt too. I was cleared, no word on my aunt but my brother account got closed??? Like wtf discover?!?!

CRedit," Ok, so I recently came up on $1500. My credit score is really bad - 525. I have 2 closed accounts for $220 and $534. I also am one month behind on my car payment $393, and that's all I have on my credit score, so it's pretty low. I would also like to apply for a secured credit card with a minimum deposit of $200 with the remaining money, but this would leave me with $0. So my question for you guys is... Should I spend the entire amount on fixing my credit score and paying my car payment, or should I put aside $1000 into a savings or IRA account? Which is more valuable? Increasing this money over time or fixing my credit score once and for all? I'm personally leaning more towards fixing my credit score once and for all because it's going to be important when I make a huge life purchase, but I also live paycheck to paycheck and I almost never have $1000 in my account so I want to save it. I know, it's really sad, but I'm working on bettering myself otherwise I wouldn't be here."
CRedit,"I may be grasping at straws here, but I have a debt in collections that may, or may not be mine...

I finally got a verification of the debt from the original client and my name is spelled incorrectly in each copy of the verification. 

I basically got screwed by this slumlord rental management company and I'm hoping this inaccuracy is enough to get me somewhere with a dispute.

Thanks in advance for your help."
CRedit,"I have very poor credit and have been denied in my attempt to get a credit card. Therefore, I would like to open a secured credit card in order to build my credit. I intend on using $300 of my own money to do this. Where should I go (bank, institution, company)?"
CRedit,"Hello. I recently got my very first credit card at the age of 30. Currently my credit score shows as 685 from credit karma, from my car loan I have been paying for the last year and a half. I am just over halfway through the loan, owing about 4.7k out of the 10k I started at. Before that, I had no credit since my previous car loan, which closed in 2013. When I received my welcome kit for the credit card, it showed me as having a score of 724 from experian.

The card is a Capital One Platinum with a $300 limit. My plan is to build credit over the next 18-24 months with the goal of getting a mortgage and owning a house. 

So how much of this credit should I utilize every month?

 I have tried searching but I can't find a definitive answer. I have found a 'rule of thumb' that you should use 30%, but less is better. Im planning on paying my phone bill , about $65, comes up to just over 20%. 

Would it be better to spend a tiny amount of 10 dollars or so, or does it not really matter as long as I do not max it out?

If my goal is building my credit for a mortgage in 1.5 or 2 years, would it make sense to apply for another credit card in about 6 months time? 

My car loan will be closed out by that time and I know average age of accounts is a factor. I would also like to get a card with cash back or some other rewards, but when I applied for one of those back in December I was declined. Maybe after some credit building with this card, I could qualify.

Thank you in advance for reading! If you need any more info let me know."
CRedit,I apologize if this is not the right subreddit for this question but this was the best one I could find. Is there an app or anything that will let me”pay myself”? I have plenty of available credit but need some more money in my bank account. Cash advance fees are always way too high. Does anyone know how to do this with little or no fees? Thanks!

Now I’m trying to get them to come to terms on the civil code violations. $2500 and the statutory violations of the disputed items that weren’t verified, a few thousand more. 

So far they aren’t budging but did offer to delete the items from my report right away, first email. Any tips out there to get them to come to the monetary part of the settlement or just end it and see them in court. I’m not loosing too much if the case doesn’t go my way... But I do have a ton of documented receipts showing how they broke the FCRA. Even a couple letters from a creditor asking them to fix one of the errors, for which they did not, a clear FCRA violation.

I’m assuming they may try to settle a monetary amount after I walk away from the talks but I’m not sure. Never have I been in this situation before."

CRedit,"I have had my bank credit card for 2 years now and just opened the VS card one week or so ago. I was having anxiety while the lady was pressuring me to open a card so I agreed to it, only to regret all my life choices once I got home. My plan now is to just use it once a month or once every 2 months, making very small transactions for a while (a year or so?), and then let it close on its own due to inactivity (after 12 months). Will this just end up hurting me in the end? My credit score is in the 780s, will closing it affect my score by much? My credit history is very short so I am not sure how good or bad this will go for me or what I should do since I know closing it will make my score go down

CRedit,"I've save up enough to make a reasonable offer to pay off my credit card debt from a collection agency (midland) in a lump sum.  My questions are do I ask for removal of the debt once paid or leave it showing as paid. Also is there any way to avoid the tax nightmare of the forgiven debt being taxed as income with a 1099C at the end of the year?  It's bad enough to pay off the debt like this, but to owe Uncle Sam on it too is insult to injury.

If anyone has settled with Midland in the past, let me know what % they took."
CRedit,"While I am sure most people on this  forum are aware of the scams that are out there to help people fix their credit, I wanted to post this because some people may google/reddit search for help with their credit and should be aware of Lexington Law Firm.

Per the [BBB website](https://www.bbb.org/us/ut/north-salt-lake/profile/credit-repair-advanced-fee/lexington-law-firm-1166-2000829) (and the [actual court filing here](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_pgx-holdings_complaint_2019-05.pdf) PDF Warning -- but it's from consumerfinance.gov, US government site):

&gt;On 05/02/2019 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a formal complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. **Charges filed allege the business is in violation of Federal law prohibiting deceptive acts and practices in violation of sections 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), and deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices in violation of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act**, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6101 et seq., and its implementing rule, the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 16 C.F.R. §§ 310.3 and 310.4. 

&gt;**Defendants also violated the law in another way. Federal law forbids requesting or receiving payment upfront for certain telemarketed credit repair services; if a company offers services represented to remove derogatory information from, or improve, a person’s credit history, credit record, or credit rating, fees can only be collected after a certain time period has elapsed and it has been demonstrated that the promised results have been achieved. As alleged below, Defendants charged consumers when they signed up for the service and on a monthly basis thereafter, without waiting the prescribed period of time and demonstrating that the promised results were achieved, in violation of the federal ban on this type of upfront fee.**"
CRedit,"According to my capital one credit card, credit wise, my score keeps going up. From the last time it’s went up 20 points from 702 to 722.

I’m wondering how accurate this really is.

I only have this one line of credit due to me trying to rebuild from when I was 18 and had 2 closed accounts.

I only have a $500 limit and have stopped trying to apply for another card because I keep getting denied and don’t want to have too many inquiries.

So I guess my question is, is the score pretty accurate or am I getting my chain pulled."
CRedit,"Sorry if this is long but I'm confused.

A collection agency for an apartment fees was listed in all of my credit reports. Balance was $1200. So March I sent them a settlement in full payment ($200) where if they endorse my check they're agreeing to accept this amount and not ask for the remaining balance AND must remove their info from the credit reports. I've done this several times before with other collection agencies without problems... until this agency. 

They endorsed &amp; deposit the check, but they're still listed in all reports. In May I sent them another request with copies of the deposited check and original request letter. They had 30-45 days to do this. Still no change.

I was told to make a compliant with CFPB, so I did on Aug 1st. That was Saturday. Today I get notified that CFPB closed my case because the collection agency said they accepted my payment but I still owe $1000 and they gave me a contact number, a person with their extension to call about so that I can get additional help to pay the remaining balance. They didn't acknowledge that they chose to agree to deposit my check. They could have returned my payment to me if they didn't agree (that's happened before). 

So now what should I do? Take them to court? Just ignore them until they sell my debt to another collection agency?"
CRedit,"So I currently have 1 credit card in my name that is showing up on my credit report and 1 that I was added as a user on so that it would help my credit. I have 3 more cards that are active and in my name but have not started showing up on my report as of yet. I was also added as a user to 1 additional account. All 6 of those accounts add up to a $8500 credit limit. I also have a student loan and personal revolving loan. I just recently paid off my car so that account closed in June. My current score is a 580 due to some missed payments on one of the cards. My wife and I have a combined annual income of $65,000/yr and we are wanting to purchase the home we are currently renting. Is there anything I can do to help increase my score for helping our chances on purchasing this house?"
CRedit,"Hello all

I have had a vehicle from a BHPH lot for 5 months now. Found out they don’t report to the credit bureaus just recently and I was informed I can contact them and self report my payments.

Thanks in advance for any information!"
CRedit,"I was reviewing the wiki on pay to delete. It says to call the collections company but the account that was charged off is not in collections or with a collections company its still with the creditor.   
The account that was charged off is a Discover card. 

I had other accounts that weren't with Discover that were charged off that I just disputed with a 605B letter and they all came off expect Discover. No matter how many times I've sent that letter it won't fall off.

My question is even though the Discover card isn't with a collections company can I still try negotiating a pay to delete or does it have to be with a collections company? I really need to get this off since its the only thing that is hurting my credit everything else that's on their looks perfect but they're still reporting it as Negative each month. So even if I pay my other card on time my Experian score won't increase"

CRedit,"So my daughter had a surgery that left us paying to three different medical companies. The bulk was to the hospital and I was paying $75 twice a month to the hospital and $50 twice a month to the other providers. I called to set up a payment plan with the hospital and they only offered me a payment of $246 monthly which didn’t work with the other two bills so they told me to call back in September before it went to collections and to pay down what I could in the meantime. 

Well, I went to make my $75 payment for the beginning of August and my balance = $0. Weird. I call and sure enough, they sent it to collections on 7/31 and are refusing to pull it back! I still owe around $3800. 

What should I do? 
Do I call to agency and try to negotiate? 
Am I forced to try to pay in full and ask them to not report? 
Do I just let it sit for 7 and say fuck it? 
Other options?!

I’ve worked SO hard to get into the 700s and now I’ll be dragged way back down. I’m taking this really hard. Help!"
CRedit,"Long story short, i payed off a card, had a recurring payment on it for my renters insurance. I thought the card was paid off but i got charged for the renters insurance. I never got a call from Capital One in regards to my balance being past due until after the 30 day mark. Now my credit has dropped 75 points from 1 missed payment. I know its up to me to keep up with the account but i was just so busy and forgot about it.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Credit Karma i have 632/633 on time payments. Is it normal for your credit to drop THAT MUCH? Its my first time being late on a payment. I tried calling capital one but they referred me to the Credit Bureau. Sounds like they don't want to help or cant help.

I have filed a dispute to try to get the past due removed from Equifax/Transunion. This is really bad timing as i am about to move and they need to check my credit. What else can i do to get this off my record?

CRedit,"A week ago, my boyfriend added me as an authorized user to his AMEX that he opened back in 2018. After talking to him about credit cards and points, I have decided that I want to open my own credit card that actually gives me points and cash back. I have three cards open right now: one from my credit union opened 5 years ago (the highest limit, the one that I actually use, doesn't have great rewards or cash back), another one from a bank that I opened 5 years ago, and my introductory credit card from when I was a student, opened 7 years ago. I have a great FICO score, and manage my credit cards wisely and pay all of my accounts on time.

My question is, will it negatively impact my credit if I open a credit card account in my own name right after he puts me as an authorized user on his card? I read online that being put on as an authorized user can negatively impact your credit, although I'm not sure why because I'm not technically responsible for the payments. He makes all of his payments on time and is incredibly financially stable, and I only have a card for convenience purposes because we live together and he pays for most things. Should I wait to get a new card on my own? TIA."
CRedit,"Hello, I am a 19 years old college student looking to get my first credit card. I was declined by Wells Fargo 5 months ago for their student credit card (I wasn’t working back then, so their reasoning was that loan-income ratio was too high)

My current student loan:$5,534 (another $5,500 on the way in the next 2 to 4 weeks).                
My current balance: $5,315 (Wells Fargo checking account).                                               
My current credit score: (given by Wells Fargo, Experian data) 643.                                               My monthly net income: $1,100-$1,300 (this might change in the next few weeks).                  My current card: No credit card, just added as an AU on my mom’s card last week, and a debit card with Wells Fargo


My questions are:

1. Can I open up a secured card with a bank I haven’t used before? I’ve been thinking of getting a Capital One account/card (I’ve heard good things about Discover secured card too)
2. Do the income-loan or other similar stats matter as much when applying for a secured card as they do for regular credit cards?
3. My parents are willing to (theoretically) chip in $1,000 or more per month; can I include that as my “income”?
4. My income will change in the next few weeks, depending on if I can find a job during school; should I just report the income I’ve been getting over summer or give the bank a rough estimate?"
CRedit,I recently got a discover student it and I am very good about handling my finances. I have a balance of 42.66. My due date is the 14th. My question is does paying the balance before the due date beneficial?

I figured I would submit a CLI request. They denied me because of my average monthly payment being “too low”. I don’t understand that reasoning because I ALWAYS pay more than the minimum and paid down the card by over $300 since May of this year. What can I do to better my chances of credit limit increase with them?
CRedit,"Hello, I have a question about the importance of diversity in your credit portfolio.

Background: I am a young male, just turned 21, with a MyFico score of 720ish. Was around 760 but I applied for 2 new cards back in early June and clearly dropped the score. My 3 Cards :

AMEX Blue Cash Card - $2000 Limit

Wells Faego Propel - $2000 Limit

Capital One Platinum master - $500 Limit

I want a Chase card but not in a rush to apply for another card yet. But my question comes from an Experian suggestion saying to expand/diversify my portfolio. Without needing a new car or home anytime soon, I found the credit builder loan idea.

Do you credit gurus think credit cards are enough for a good score or would applying for a small loan and paying it off on-time actually help my credit score?"

I'm dealing with a weird one. I have a letter from an account thats a final letter dated 7/31/20. The letter says that if the balance isnt paid off within 10 days that it'll go to the collections agency. when i called them about it, i was told it was sent to collections on 7/31...

Is this an ok/legal thing to happen?"
CRedit,"I'm trying to do everything I can to get as on top of my credit as soon as possible. I've paid off one of my old (4 years ago) collections, and will be paying off

&amp;#x200B;

I've been pre-approved for the Discover secured card which I have been told switches to an unsecured after about 6 months of good payment history. CreditKarma has also told me that I've got a good chance of being approved for Destiny, Milestone, Fingerhut, Indigo, and CreditOne unsecured cards. None of them seem to be what I'm ultimately looking for (rewards, cash back, travel perks, etc...). I'm pretty new to all of this, so any help will be much appreciated.

CRedit,"Hey guys! Wow, it feels great to have rebuilt my FICO credit score. I’m a 5th year college student. I have a BoA cash rewards card, discover it student card, and an amazon store card. (As well as student loans). So, what do I do now to get my score even higher aside from paying off my cards completely every couple weeks?"
CRedit,"I have 2 student loans right now. One for $1,500 that I took out around a year ago. And another $500 loan that I took out in June for summer classes. Both of these loans are subsidized, so I haven't been accruing any interest (: 

Good news is I'll be getting extra scholarships this academic year (enough to pay off my 2k loans completely). I started paying attention to my credit since I just got my first credit card the other day in the mail (Discover It Student Card). And essentially, I'm unsure if I should pay off my debt all at once or if I should separate it into payments. This might sound dumb, but for some reason I remember hearing that your credit goes higher if you pay off something consistently over time, and not just the full payment all at once. 

What should I do?"
CRedit,Does that mean that when the past due accounts drop off from my credit report (7 years later) that they will not issue me a card? Do they keep record even after it drops off your credit?

I am willing to pay the full amount.

I highly doubt I'll be able to get that offer again in writing but has anyone had any success in getting a PFD on something you've already paid on?"
CRedit,"I don't understand why my Experian report says that my 6 student loan accounts are closed and those accounts each show 28 charge offs.

 I realize this is because I just didn't pay these loans, but that's because right after I left school and before the repayment was supposed to start my school(Wyotech) got sued out of business and I was told that my loans were supposed to be discharged because of the fraud of the school. But I missed some step in getting mine taken care of or something, I wasn't supposed to have to pay these. 

What I don't know or understand maybe, is if these loan accounts show as closed and charged off are they still negatively impacting my score and do I still need to pay them off? Maybe I just don't understand what's a charge off really mean? 

Experian says I have a 584 FICO score 8. I would really like to start repairing this and building it so I can one day buy a home. But I have a ""thin file"" and a high utilization because I have one secured loan on a tool box and my $200 line of credit from my bank which I used recently cause of covid19 struggles but even $100 on that shows high utilization. 

I have lots of ontime payments and positive closed accounts. Bought a car and paid it off, bought other tools for work and paid them off etc.  

The other thing I found out is that if I file my taxes they will take my return for the loans. So I cant use that cash to make the larger purchases I used to use it for because I have trouble getting things financed. It was my workaround the credit score issue. I've put off filing my taxes last year and this year because of this and it's caused me to not get my stimulus either."
CRedit,"Hello everyone,

I encouraged my boyfriend to get a credit card last year when he was working a full time job to get him started on building his credit. He made a stupid mistake and kept using it and not paying the bill once he stopped working. Eventually Chase closed his checking account and the credit card. About 3 months after the accounts were closed, I found out about what had happened and I helped him pay off what he owed to chase, which was about double his limit due to late fees. His fico credit score is about 550. I was thinking of adding him as an authorized user on one of my low APR/ low limit cards.

Will adding him to a card as an authorized user help him rebuild his credit at all? I know there’s nothing we can do about the closed card on his report, but I’m wondering if him being involved on a card that is used and paid off monthly will help. 

 He won’t actually be using the card."

CRedit,"I recently gave birth at the end of April, and thus have received a couple medical bills associated to that. Being a complete sleep-deprived idiot, I totally forgot about two of them. One is for $203 and the other for $38. Also, based on my claim history with Blue Cross there is another $53 charge that I have yet to receive a bill for, nor is that charge on my online portal with the medical provider. 

I paid the $38 and $203 bills today once I realized that I had forgotten about them. What tipped my memory was a final notice from the place that sent the $38 one saying if I didn’t pay in 15 days it would be sent to collections. Below are my questions:

- I paid the $38 with two days to spare. This was based on the statement date, even though I JUST received that bill in the mail. What will happen if they don’t process that payment in time? 
- I never received a reminder bill for the $203 charge, and it was still with the medical provider. I should be good here then, right?
- I have read that medical collections won’t show on report unless 180 days old and unpaid, is this accurate? Would that be 180 days from the medical service, from the medical bill, or from the collection account?
- I did not receive any bills until 6/1 (birth was 4/27)...how are they already talking collections? I thought that was put off until at least 90 days past due? Or is that 90 days past service (which would then be correct, because it’s been 98 days)

I am calling about the missing $53 bill tomorrow when they are open, so hopefully I can resolve that. I apologize for the long post/freak out. I will be applying for a mortgage within the next 6ish months, and am just really worried about this. My credit score is really good (730), and I’m afraid I just screwed it all up. 

It’s totally my fault, being a new mom is exhausting!! However, they do kind of make this extra confusing with multiple bills from multiple different providers even when the service was all done at the same hospital in a time when your brain isn’t all there. It’s like they want you to not pay it!"
CRedit,"So long story short I have been an authorized user on my parents Costco card for a few years so I could go to the store while in school, I ended up paying for my stuff on my debit card and that was that. Turns out, this card is 100% utilized and I don't expect that to change anytime soon, I would love to get this removed because obviously its putting a huge ding on my utilization rate, any advice? Also, once removed what do I need to do to ensure it doesn't show up on my report anymore? Thanks!"
CRedit,"Does anyone know why my credit score keeps going up and down throughout the year? I pay every month my statement balance like I’m supposed to, I keep my utilization rate under 5% - I have AMEX Delta Skymiles Gold and Chase Freedom credit cards and I check my credit score on Credit Karma or on websites that AMEX and Chase provide.

What I mean by up and down: on December 2019 I’ve score as 756 then it jumped down to 746 then up to 758 then 756 and 751 and then all the way to 771 as of right now of August...eventually it went up in the 8 months by 20 points which is great but can anyone explain what makes it go down? 

- FICO score is 799
- Equifax / Transunion is 771

What I thought it might be is that I currently live in Europe so I spend USA dollars from my credit here in Europe and then send money back to my banks via TransferWise from my international account; not sure though. As per my understanding it should usually go only up, and not see drops like 10 points for no reason. Why is that happening? Does anyone have the same experience? Is that normal? Or what score is more reliable FICO from Amex or the one from Credit Karma?"
CRedit,"Someone close to me (close enough to be comfortable divulging personal financial struggles) recently expressed some apprehension in their deal with FDR, especially since they have been offered an interest free loan from a well-to-do cousin to pay off some debt to relieve some pressure. Have any of you had experience backing out of an agreement with them, or know the conditions? They’ve already paid into their account for 4 months or so. Would they be able to get that money back if it hasn’t been applied to one of their creditors? They’d much rather get help and grind for a year or so vs. risking bad credit for 7 years. I know that once the drowning feeling subsided, they were able to see their options more clearly without desperation. I appreciate any guidance."

CRedit,"This might be a stupid question but I’m just curious...

I’m a student and have one student loan from the first university I attended which is fully paid off. I now attend a public university  and get full financial aid. My question is, are there any downsides to me taking out  a student loan of let’s say $2,500 a semester and paying it fully off a month later to build credit? 

I know each student loan is listed as a separate/new account on your credit report so I’m guessing each new account will help my score eventually (once fully paid off)"
CRedit,"Hello I tried to remove a paid collections account from my report. I've had a 720 score my entire time of credit. Recently the va did an audit on my school and turns out I was over paid. They mailed the notice and collections to an address I havent lived in for 4 years. 
I tried to do it myself but it doesnt seem like I'm getting anywhere. Would a credit repair company like Lexington law be able to atleast negotiate the impact on my credit?"
CRedit,I’m sure this has been asked a thousand times but my credit karma score shows me at 594 while my “vantage” score through my chase app shows me at 667 why the huge jump? Can someone help explain. Which should I be taking seriously?
CRedit,So I have a car loan that I've been paying off I have 20 payments under my belt and so far have made every payment on time.  My lender told me that I have a 10 day grace period about 2 months ago and Me being the gullible one paid my last 2 payments 2-3 days after my due date. Checked my score recently and Boom! dropped 34 points but the payments were reported on time. Any idea if there is a correlation or just coincidence?
CRedit,Will be turning 18 soon and I’m wondering if you guys have any advice for beginners about credit cards.
CRedit,"I had a chase card from 2008. My FICO averaged a score of 780 when I accepted the card, but the interest was 19%. I was never late with payment but they refused to lower the rate. I entered into a hardship program about 18 months ago. I have been making my payments on time every month since, but they have been reporting to the 3 big CRA as agreed partial payment plan. This has really pissed me off.

Would i be taking a big hit on my score and credit file if I decided to just stop paying at this point?

I'm particularly looking into the Double Cash Card as general spending card, since I have revolving rewards from Discover, and focus with gas and groceries from AMEX. This would also be my 4th credit line, broadening my credit file. Also, my credit scores seem to not have reported my AMEX credit account."
CRedit,"Hi! I am 22 with a TU score of 756 Equifax score of 742, my first credit card was a Capital One card that I fucked up on 4 years ago and missed a payment by a few days. I closed that account last year (wasn’t using it) but the missed payment’s still on my report. I am trying to erase any negatives off my score (only other thing is a medical collection from 3 yrs ago), was wondering what approach I could take to try and get the missed payment demerit removed."
CRedit,Hello I opened a credit card in 2018 and was behind and went out into collections I paid it off but my credit score disappeared. I got a social security number about 3 years ago. That was one of my only accounts ipaid everything trying to do the right thing but I think I broke my credit😔 please help!TIA😊
CRedit,"Hi all, wife and I are looking to purchase a home but are also looking for short term rentals in the meantime. If I am shopping for a mortgage and a rental hard inquiry is also run, will it hurt my credit if i am within the 45 day window for a credit check?"
CRedit,"Hello

So my situation is .. I was in a good job but irresponsible with the way I was using my cards, I was barely out of high school and I thought oh, this will be an easy payment and took out plenty of stuff. But then I lost that job and was jobless for a while so I have a lot of missed payments and I had to settle for less on my Best Buy card.  I have almost no debt now and I hired some credit specialists and they said they disputed everything negative, and my score went up from 420 to 650s

My question is, the credit repair specialists haven’t removed all the late payments on my accounts and I want to apply for a new card or the get the Best Buy card again (with smarter buying , of course) but I’m scared of the inquiry to just get a declined. Any advice? 

I have like a 78% positive payment history ( according the credit Karma) but I have no debt, oldest account is 5 years , no collections, no derogatory marks, only 1 recent inquiry but it was a secured credit card I got last December 2019. 

The credit repair guys say they’re still working on it but I feel like it’s going nowhere, I feel my score went up only because I paid everything off.

Oh and I’m getting my scores from multiple locations

Credit Karma, Capital One CreditWise, Chase banking account (they have an option to view your credit score on the app) , Experian, credit sesame. (I’ve been really trying to fix it lol)

The only one that hasn’t updated but it’s barely been like 1-2 months max is the discover card, but they’re the ones I had the most debt with (paid off already). With them I’m still a 550"
CRedit,"Hello everyone! 

So I screw up my credit and ended up with low 540’s. I managed to get it up to 620’s in 3 months since I decided to settle all accounts since I had enough money to do that (still paid about 7,000) but now my problem is that some of the creditors said they would send me letters stating we have settled but instead they either won’t send it or they reported it as current but still owing a balance. I don’t know how to make them honor their offers to settle. Should I contact them again?(5th time’s the charm)or hire a credit lawyer??

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!!!"
CRedit,"I currently have 3 credit cards all with small limits (approximately $12,000 overall). One of my cards has given me issues 3 months in a row. I make the payment on time on the app and then it waits 5 days to post it and then charges me a late fee and ups my next months payment. The first time it happened I thought it was an error on my part but these last 2 months I am positive that it was not an issue on my part. Contacted the company and they are not willing to help or look into it at all. 

So I'd like to open a 4th card and transfer my balance from that card to the new one until I can pay it off and just not use the card that's giving me issues.

I'd like to do this to avoid fees and stop getting late payments on my credit. I've got good credit (730-740 FICO) and would like to avoid having it be hurt over this."
CRedit,"Ok a little back story, got approved for a mortgage loan back in early June, my score was 700 or so. Fast forward a few weeks and we had to change lenders, my credit was ran again and this time I had a 569 (From what I read it was an Experian Fico score)
Needless to say I was swiftly denied.
For context, I missed a payment on a credit card back in mid June. I paid it in July in full. 
Now here is the confusing part:
I was denied two weeks ago with the 569 score.
As of today when I log into Experian and check my Fico 8, it says my score is 720. It shows the mark from June in the credit account that was missed hasn’t been paid yet. (It has but I guess it hasn’t been reported) It is the only mark on my credit.
Are there any key factors I am missing/could look into? 
I am hesitant to have the lender run it again because I already have 4 hard hits on my credit and am afraid I am not seeing something clearly."
CRedit,"Been steadily building my credit through a BOA credit card, a SELF loan, Mocafi rent reporting and Experian boost with my electric bill. I woke up today with an alert from Experian that my credit score had dropped from a 746 to a 710 for a missed payments. 

There are no new missed payments, all are 100% and exceptional. 

The only mark on my credit score is 2 missed payments for a Citizens Bank self secured loan from 5 years ago which I've been told MULTIPLE times, they were going to completely remove.

How is this possible?"
CRedit,"I do plan to use my credit soon as we look for a new house, which is why I am strategizing to improve it.  There is not a set timeline yet as the Rona has everything up in the air, but I know I have to be ready because it can move fast when it is ready.

Credit on credit karma is 768. (Yes I know it isn't completely accurate but is a good guide for right now and always trended well with whatever accurate feedback I have gotten in the past). It also reported a
 15 point drop in the last month that I can't seem to attribute to anything.

 My major ding is a 30 day late payment from 3 years ago (co-signed loan from an ex. He let the last payment go exactly 31 days late as a FU) so that is at 99%

Avg.  Length of credit is 4.0 years.

1 inquiry only 6 months old.

Credit utilization about 6% always under 10%.


The only thing not fixed by time may be my average age of accounts. My thought is to increase my average age of credit by closing a recent credit card.  A card opened 1.5 years ago to get 0% financing on the air conditioner currently paid off.  This card has a 5000 credit limit.

  I currently have 66,100 in available credit and pay everything off monthly.

There are two other accounts I can also take off the recent side of my age of accounts another credit card and a car loan that we are working on paying off.

So is it worth my time doing this? Is there something I am missing?  Is there a better way to improve?"
CRedit,"Hi folks,

I’m at a loss. My soon to be ex husband and I have decided he will keep our house. We had him all set up to refinance solo. In April, apparently our escrow amount changed by $56. We paid our normal April payment but we were totally unaware our rate changed. When he paid in person at a bank branch, we were not told. May 5 I received a call letting me know the payment was short. I then asked (on the recorded line) whether it would be okay to just tack that onto the following month since it was such a small amount (our regular payment was ~2600) to which she said yes no problem. Now we have a hit on our credit as a missed payment.... for $56. We have a pristine 7 year history with them having NEVER missed a payment. I initiated an investigation through the credit bureau and was told today by the bank there is nothing they can do and I should write the credit bureau so they can make an annotation.

Helllllp! We are supposed to finalize our divorce on Wednesday but we can’t until his refinance is solidified. I’m a stressed out mess.... there has GOT to be some way to fix this."
CRedit,"Im 24 with a credit of 640. just recently started to build my credit. I got a couple of credit cards and have been spending about 20% of my credit line and paying it off on time. The only thing that’s holding me back is 2 medical bills in collections from a couple of years ago. I’m total it’s only $300 which I can pay. However, I want it off my report. What’s the best way to do this??"
CRedit,"I was past due paying a college semester, however there is no loan in my name, will this affect my credit score?"
CRedit,"Long story short, I have 650 credit score due to $50k in credit card debt(way over 30% utilization)...working on pay-off through snowball approach but wondering if I should continue with monthly payments or get a loan to pay off debt and repay just the loan. Looking for advice and experience.

Thanks in advance :)

MORE INFO: I want to increase my score to purchase my car, currently leased, and don't want a super high-interest rate or high monthly payments.

UPDATED: Vantage score"
CRedit,"So this is a pretty straightforward issue I talked with the banker about having my secured card turned into a regular credit card and he knew that my credit score was a 690(we had an in depth conversation of me going from 490 when I got the secured to the current 690 and how I pay for monitoring/live scores)and also knew that the minimum score(fico 8) was a 700 but did not tell me that he then still had me apply and obviously it was declined given the reason of having a score under 700. I just had another card with another bank switched to a regular card. Im pretty annoyed because I look like im fishing for credit and the whole point was to free cash because I'm looking to finance my home in the next 6 months. 

Also if he knew I didn't meet the requirements why would he still have me apply? Quota or something?"
CRedit,When I was 18 I opened a credit card. I ended up using it all and never paying it. Since than it has gone to collection. The thing is on my TransUnion report it shows that the card has been closed. But on my Equifax report it shows that it is open and I have $0 utilization. I tried reporting to Equifax that the account was closed and gave a date of when. However they sent a thing back saying the information was accurate and it is still on my credit report. Should I just leave it on my report since it makes my available line of credit bigger than it really is? Or should I report it closed and if so how would I do it?
CRedit,"We are in the middle of closing on a house. Only my husband is applying for the mortgage loan. I, on the other hand, start school in less than a month and trying to get the payment plan situated. I've already apply for federal student aid (sub and unsub loan) but have not accepted them yet in fear it might show up in my husbands credit report if in case the lender checks his credit report again before we close. I also need to apply for a private student loan. I've been delaying that as I know it affects your credit score but I plan to only apply in my name with no cosigner. And I need to apply soon!

My question is if either the federal student aid (FAFSA) and/or the private student loan will affect and show up in my husband's credit report if I only apply under my name?"
CRedit,"Updated (1 time)
Hi guys so I am 33, full time job, not looking to buy a house, completely happy with where I am in life! At the moment my scores are 741 (Transunion) 749 (Equifax) using credit karma. I’ve never really been big into my credit score or really cared much so I guess I should be thankful they’re this high. I am however very competitive and now that my fiancé has me hooked on my credit score like it’s a game I want to raise it as close to 850 as I can for no other reason then to gloat (as bad as that sounds)! So my questions are....


1.
Are there random things I can do to bump my score up a few points here and there? 

2.
Are there better ways to be checking my score, without hurting it other then Credit Karma?(I am always scared of scams)

3.
Does anyone else kind of look at your credit score like a game or an achievement rather than in the serious nature we probably should look at it?

4.
That Experian Credit Boost has to be a total scam! 🤔 or is it??? I’d really like to know if anyone has tried it!

5.
My Fiancé’s one question she wants to know is why does it take 7 years for late payments to come of your credit? (I’m rocking a perfect payment history and gloat about it)



In advance. I look forward to your responses and I’m very thankful for those who take the time to help me. I’m sorry I hope there truly is no such thing as a stupid question! And I’m not trying to offend anyone!

UPDATE: 
through Experian my FICO is 729"
CRedit,"Okay, I know this sounds like an absolutely ridiculous question (and it very possibly is), but please hear me out first.

I'm an 18 (almost 19) year old sophomore in college. I have 3 credit cards so far (I got the first one in December) and have diligently used then paid them off, which is hopefully somewhat evident by my Fico scores:

712, 723, 720 (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, respectively).

According to the Experian app, the only 2 things keeping my credit scores down are:

1. Short account history
2. No loan activity/no diversity in credit

Okay, there's no way to fix short account history other than continuing to use and pay off my cards. However, I can maybe fix the lack of loan activity. I'm on full scholarship for four years, so I don't have student loans and really don't plan on having any for the rest of my undergrad. But I'm thinking I can apply for an unnecessary personal loan. My plan for this loan would be to immediately pay back half of it, divide the remaining balance by 12, and pay that amount monthly, while never actually using the loan money for anything. If I don't get this personal loan, I really wouldn't have any loan activity until I finance a car or house, but that's quite a while from now. 

I've been thinking about this lately and haven't been able to come to a solid conclusion. Any and all advice on this is welcome. I'm not really looking for general credit improvement advice, although I would welcome it if you're so inclined. Thank you in advance for your time and help!"
CRedit,"Hi everybody,

Sorry for the long post, but wanted to make sure I explained the issue comprehensively. In a nutshell, after a credit disaster in 2017, I rapidly get back on track and by late 2018 my scores are great. By January 2020, my scores have tanked and I haven't been able to really improve them. Thanks for the help!

Back in the Summer of 2017, I had a minor credit meltdown. I let the balance on a BofA card get up to $9,200 and didn't pay anything for more than 60 days. I also didn't pay a much smaller $500 balance on an Amex card and just ignored it for several months. Yes, I'm an idiot. I also had student loans and a mortgage at the time that I didn't miss any payments on.

BofA deactivated my card but I methodically paid off the balance over the next year so by Summer of 2018 the entire balance was paid off. Unfortunately BofA wouldn't reactivate the card because they said that specific card had been suspended. This was a blow because it was my oldest account (over 15 years). AmEx sent me a letter saying that they would issue me a crappy Optima credit card if I paid off what was now a $700-ish balance with them. I knew my credit score was likely garbage so I took them up on this offer. 

Despite these CC issues, I had student loans that I never missed a payment on and paid off completely at the beginning of this year. I also have had a mortgage for 4.5 years I never missed a payment on.

By the Fall of 2018, to my surprise my credit score had significantly increased to the point it was decent - low 700s. I took out a new credit card and managed it responsibly and my credit score went up. In 2019, I got a little ahead of myself and opened three new credit cards. I have managed them responsibly and paid on time every month. These dinged my scores when I opened them up but not by too much.

More recently, in the Fall of 2019 a collection showed up on my account. It's from an old issue for only $125, but unfortunately just appeared on my reports. I also had to take out a personal loan in January for $4,000 to replace my heating system.

These two things have seemed to tank my scores and they have only increased a tiny amount over the past 7 months. CreditKarma says I'm fine (low-to-mid 700s) but my Credit Cards have free FICO scores and those are much worse (ranging from 662 to 695). Since the whole 2017 issue, I have paid every account on time, and my amount of credit used compared to what's available is very low - always less than 5 percent. So I'm trying to figure out what's killing my score.

All of the sites say I have too many recent inquiries and subpar average credit age. I know the collection is not helpful, but it doesn't explain the 70 point drop and barely any improvement. 

I have paid off the $4000 personal loan taken out in January to the point there's only a few hundred bucks left on it. I'm thinking of calling my bank to see if they'll increase my loan amount, just so I can keep the account open, because I think closing an account that's only been open 7 months will tank my score. Also I still have my crappy Amex card with a $500 limit and $50 annual fee. I would like to cancel it to avoid the stupid fee but am also scared closing the account after 2 years will hurt me. Do you guys think that would help? Is there something else I'm missing?

The only other thing that might be hurting me is that although I pay my credit card balances fully every month, sometimes they show a small balance on the statement because a pending charge will materialize or I buy something between the account due date and statement date.

Thank you very much for any help. It's frustrating to not have your scores improve when you feel like you've been doing the right things for a while."
CRedit,"All of my google searches explain the importance of aged accounts, giving advice as if I am about to end the journey but I am just starting it. I am just wondering if my score will be affected at all with me enrolling in a payment plan and starting to pay monthly, as opposed to the more financially prudent option of putting it in forbearance for the next year. 

Had a rough past 2 years, got my score back up to 630 today after recently adding revolving activity to my account again, and in one more year ill have several horrible marks off my credit and the goal is to get married and get a house! 

I never really post here but browse everyday, so thought id give a shout out along with my question. Thank you everyone!!!"
CRedit,"as of now, my credit score is 717. My friend wants to finance a motorcycle so he asks for me to cosign, I'm not concern about late payment since he has more than enough to pay it off. He wants to build his credit since he just got a credit card. I have 6 hard inquiries,5 from a submitted application that I decided not to proceed with, and 1 from opening a new credit line, so I'm not sure how consigning will affect my score.

I am concern about the 5 inquiries (viewed by multiple institutions) , is this normal? 

Is it a bad idea to cosign?

Please help, and thank you!!"
CRedit,"Hello,

I have around an 800 credit score, but recently I accidentally missed a payment by 40 days (thought the account was on autopay). I never received any notice about my late payment and only discovered it when I was just browsing my accounts. The account is now paid in full and when I called them they told me that the late payment will be reported.  Has anyone has success with a goodwill letter with synchrony bank? Any tips? What addresses should I send it to? Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you"
CRedit,"Hi, I'm (22f) trying to get my life together. I attended college from 18-19 but ended up dropping out. With plans to return. But I have a hold on my college from a small debt of 101 dollars...and it's been sent to collections. I also have a debt of 1,042 from a hospital bill from when I was in college but my dad had lied about me being on insurance or something when I wasn't so he offered to pay for that...but didn't. That also went into collections. I'm not in huge debt but I've read paying directly to collections leaves a 7 year stain.

Is there any way I can pay these debts without it affecting my credit? I don't have a credit card at all but really need to start. I'm also aiming to get an apartment within the next 6 months? Any advice helps as I have never been properly advised by my parents and I have remained very docile about these sorts of things. I know it all comes down to my responsibility and that's where I want to be, responsible. I don't want the 7 year stain."
CRedit,"I missed 2mo payment for 2 loans in the same bank and brought my score down 50+ points, is there hope to fix this?

Longer version:
Missed the 2 payments because i forgot to renew my transfers therefore it never sent the money to the account where they pull the money for the loan payment.

I have had this bank for over 10yrs, multiple loans and all paid on time and all off. I just recently paid both loans balance off because i was pissed that i missed the payments and my credit went down."
CRedit,"One time I applied for a personal unsecured loan and the reason for denial was:

“ Lack of installment loan history / loan payment history”

Its a conundrum of chicken or the egg came first. You need an installment loan to build loan history. But you cant get a loan because you havent had installment loans. Any tips or advice such as start small of a $1000 loan?

My credit card profile is fine of I have 8 credit cards, but trying to build on loans. 

Thank you!"
CRedit,I can’t find anything online that lets me know if this is legit. I can’t fathom not paying for something like this. Is it legit?
CRedit,"I’ve got the capital one platinum card and a car loan, but I’d like to get a few more cards. I don’t think I’d qualify for the cards I want, but I don’t want to use any hard inquiries just to check to see what I’m qualified for. What should I do?"
CRedit,"Alternative to Self Lender. Used them in the past but currently they lowered the amount of the loan repayments. In the past and I had 2 loans each at 200.00 per month for 12 months. Currently the highest amount loan per month is 150.00 per month and you cannot have more than 1 at a time.

Basically,

I am looking for something like self lender  where I can obtain a secured installment loan without the money upfront. But with a higher amount that I can pay- like 200-400 per month for only 12 months.

I use self lender of course to build credit but I also use it to get rid of cash for 12 months.

Self Lender (to me) is like a savings account but an account I am forced (so to speak) to send in money whether I want to or not and I cannot touch the money no matter what the reasons are for 12 months. Money is out of site out of mind, so to speak for 12 months.

Anything out there like that? I dont care about the finance charge either because to me its a convenience fee for the service they offer and what I use it for as a tool for myself."
CRedit,"I’m trying to rebuild my credit.  My FICO 8 is currently 645.  The utilization across three credit cards is approximately 50% and I’ve been diligently working on paying them down.

The card in question is my Care Credit card.  I opened it about a year ago to cover some needed veterinary expenses.  They offer 0% financing on certain purchases so I’ve been lucky enough to not have to pay interest yet.  I was close to having it paid off when my rabbit got sick again, and I didn’t have cash so had to charge it.  So of course my utilization will go back up with this charge.

I’m thinking about asking for a credit increase on this card to offset the utilization from new charges.  (My current limit is a modest $500.)  Will they do any kind of inquiry, being that I’m a current customer?  Will the inquiry ding my score more than boost it from a better utilization ratio?  Is it worth it?

Also, in the near-ish future I hope to open an additional credit card (a second BoA cash rewards card is what I have in mind) and refinance a HELOC (my current one has too high an interest rate).  Will asking for a credit increase now affect either of these?

Update:  I asked for an increase to $800.  I figured it was a modest bump they were sure to approve.  They actually gave me an increase to $1500!  Woohoo!"
CRedit,"I have never had a credit card. I have no debt whatsoever. 

While opening a credit card makes me slightly uneasy, I want to build good credit for important future purchases like a house or when my current vehicle inevitably dies. 

I have been warned my entire life about how dangerous credit cards can be so I am dipping my toe into this with extreme caution. Believe me when I say that credit card debt is one of my biggest fears, which makes me feel alright about how ill use a credit card (responsibly, fuelled by this severe anxiety. I’m not joking though)

Anything you wish you could go back and tell yourself before you got a credit card? Please help me go into this informed and set me up for success. 

I try to live a minimalist lifestyle so I don’t really care about rewards that much unless they’re for travel.. I’ve done some research and it seems like a cash back card would be best for me. It seems though that I don’t spend that much per month at all (compared to the average I guess?) so my annual cash back would be something tiny like $150. At this point, would focusing on a card with no annual fee and low interest rates be my best bet? 

My #1 concern is building good credit, that’s it that’s all. My plan was to maybe pay just one of my monthly bills (which is exactly $300 every month) with the credit card and not use it for anything else. Would building credit take me my entire lifetime if I went with this strategy? 

The last thing I want is to be paying for something, see my credit card, think “whatever!” And then one thing leads to another and I live with deep regret for years to come."
CRedit,"My wife and I applied for an apartment this week, and now it looks like we may not get it due to our desired move in date. They ran both of our credit scores during the application process, which triggered a hard inquiry and a drop in score. 

So now of course we need to apply to other apartments. Will other apartment credit checks be lumped into 1 hard inquiry, or will our scores go down with each check?"
CRedit,"I have seen friends open cards to get promotional offers like the 0% plus the bonus points or cashback. Then once the promotion end they close the card and they reapply for the same card to get the same promotion again. They basically do this every 12 or 15 months depending on how long the 0% APR is good for.

My question is how bad is that for your credit in the long run or even short term? Has anyone here done that and their credit is fine? I don't feel comfortable doing that with my credit, to be honest."
CRedit,"At the start of the new year, I decided I'd had enough of my awful credit and decided to really commit to making positive changes so that my husband and I could get a mortgage at a decent rate in a year or two. I made a lot of stupid decisions that ultimately brought my FICO/Vantage scores to an all time low of around 450. I couldn't qualify for anything - it was super embarrassing being asked by cashiers to try and qualify for a store card and knowing my credit was so shitty it wasn't worth it. I swore I would have awful credit for the rest of my life (I'm 29). 

I started browsing this subreddit and the myFICO forums for advice on how to start repairing my credit. I started by paying off $500 worth of old collections I'd let sit around on my report for 5 years and my score jumped up to 620. I paid off my credit card balances I'd been shoveling minimum payments and over the next four months, my score gradually climbed and it's currently sitting at a 701. My next major hurdle was the late payments on my report - I consolidated my student loans and 10 late payments turned my payment history from 98% to 80%.

I made some bad choices with my auto loan about 3 years ago and my mistakes were haunting me. I asked around and everyone told me I had no chance in hell and that this specific lender never changes factual information, but I tried anyways. I wrote a goodwill letter explaining why I missed payments, what I learned from it and used my positive payment history since to ask for mercy. I addressed it to the VP of Customer Service and sent it via email.

Today I received a call from his assistant letting me know that they would be removing ALL of my late payments (10!) and sending me a letter for confirmation. It should take about 45 days for the credit bureaus to update the status, but I will have a perfect payment history when they do. I'm so excited and I just had to share with the good folks here."
CRedit,"Hello! I use discover and they report on the closing date (I assume that’s for most of not all CC companies? Correct me if I’m wrong please!). I just updated my closing date to match with my new credit card, so does that mean my bureaus will update on that new day?

When I go into the experian app they always update on the 5th. Is that a fixed date? Or is it just because that’s the date that discover reported? Because moved my date will my bureaus update to that date?

I hope I made sense. Thank you!"
CRedit,"Hi all, not sure if this is the right sub for this. last year I almost went into foreclosure, and almost lost my home, thankfully the bank worked with me and approved me for a loan modification. I’ve been working hard on my Credit score...before my mortgage fico score was sitting in the low 500s . Now im in the 630 mark."
CRedit,"My eqifax and trans union are over 700 but for some reason my experion is stuck at 590. Two accounts that helped my other scores had no effect on my experion, is it possible that they aren’t reporting? If so what to do?"
CRedit,"Ok so I’ll try to make this as short as possible. I’ve been recently trying to rebuild my credit. Back in 2014 was my DOFD. The collection got reported to Enhanced Recovery in 2016. Long story short. My credit has been going up. I’m currently sitting at 622 Transunion and 616 Equifax. So recently I called the company just to get more info on the debt without giving to much information to see if I can dispute it to get it removed since it’s been so long. They were trying to tell me settlement amounts and blah blah to which I told her to validate the debt in writing or email before any discussion of payment and she refused saying that she’s not able to do that, she can only say it over the phone. I’d like to know what are my next steps as I checked my Credit Karma and it seems the debt won’t fall off till July 2027 now according to the automatic bot you can speak to on Credit Karma. 

I’d like to know what my next steps should be? I have already disputed through Credit Karma and they said it meets requirements. If the debt clock is reset, should I just negotiate a pay for delete. 

I am trying to improve my score for a new car I want to buy. I appreciate any info you guys can give me.

EDIT: VANTAGE SCORES"
CRedit,"Morning guys, little bit of a lurker here...unfortunately get to seek advice. My credit has steadily improved as we plan to buy a house soon so I want to tread lightly with any credit related decisions. 

Rec’d a letter from SIMM associates about an old PayPal credit account. Lists origination date of 8/28/2015 and charge off date of 2/2/2017. None of this activity (PayPal account, charge off or collection) is on my credit report as of now so I don’t really want to rock the boat. That said I don’t want either of those things to happen within next 6mos or so. I’m really just trying to find out of the date of the last delinquency is &gt;7yrs. They didn’t list that information and since it’s not an account on my report I can’t see for myself. 

My question is this: should I request a DV letter asking for the standard, including last delinquency or just let it lie.

FWIW, lists Synchrony as current creditor, Bill Me Later as the services and then also references PayPal Credit in the body of the letter. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated"
CRedit,"I had a charge off and then a judgement for a debt and then paid it off. I had no idea what I was doing at the time and paid in full, (""Satisfaction of Judgement"") figuring that once it was paid, my credit would ""go back to normal.""

I have zero debts now and that was the only credit card I owned. My credit score is around 580ish. (Vantage) I was wondering what my options were to fix my credit, other than just waiting? 

Thank you in advance! I'm only starting to learn about this, so any advice is appreciated!"
CRedit,"Let's say i order food and pay with my credit card that has a limit of $1000 but a balance of zero; i wait a few days and the $10 purchase posts to my account balance. 

Is it good or bad to immediately pay off the balance back to zero if the main goal is to increase your credit score?

TIA!

CRedit,"So, recently me and the wife have been talking about buying a home, it would be our first time buying a home, as we have been renting for the last 7 years. 
My credit is currently at 580 ( I know it’s not good) but my history is the thing. I’ve paid off a car, only missed like two payments but caught them up. I don’t have a credit card, and my new car is perfect payments. The bank I tried to get a loan from said it’s because of my hospital visits ( I’ve got really bad asthma, visited them recently due to corona and being scared from early January) and a little before. 
I’m just not sure how to fix my credit, people say get a credit card and use it once a month and pay it off on time, but is it that simple?
I was trying to get a FHA loan, couldn’t happen apparently.
Anyone have any suggestions? 
Thanks in advance!"
CRedit,"Hey I’m in college and got approved for my first card, I’d like to do it for small purchases that I can pay back no sweat. 

What are the do’s and don’ts besides the basic don’t get things you won’t be able to afford.

For instance should you always pay your balance off early or not?"
CRedit,"I have 2 medical collections from Americollect $74 each. 3.5 yrs old. Will it make a difference in score if I pay (or get them removed) since they are so old? 779 FICO EX. Any advice appreciated.

BONUS Question: Best way to finance cosmetic surgery?"
CRedit,"Self explanatory. I tried to make a large purchase and the limit was automatically/instantly bumped down several thousand dollars and card got denied (I checked it earlier in the day). I called, they told me to submit income/assets documentation and suggested it may because of my large amount of credit card debt.

I do have plenty of money in my bank account (enough to easily cover my Amex credit limit). I've been holding off on paying down my other outstanding debts because I'm on UI and you know, the situation is uncertain. But just so it's clear, with UI + PUA, I've easily maintained my income level (you know, the one they looked at before setting my initial credit limit). And you know. It just so happens the PUA payments end this week.

They also know I have additional household income from family. They asked me about all that. They already knew but asked anyway. 

Here's the thing. I have previously, for years, up until I got this job last year (and paid it all off at once), carried my Amex at its max credit limit, always paying just above minimum payments, never missing a payment. In fact, I have, until last year, been carrying even more overall debt than I am now. Like, all my cards maxed debt.. Their decision almost bewildered me because of this history and the nature of credit card companies. I'm known for paying years of unnecessary interest and then also the principal? Isn't that what they're looking for? Free money?

Well, apparently not anymore. You can probably guess why they've changed their strategy. They're looking to flag anyone who might not be able to pay their debts due to the current pandemic caused environment and whose unemployment money is about to run out.

In any case, they waited to confirm the decision until I had to show them my bank statements and they could verify I was on UI.

I don't know, this just rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not usually a principled person when it comes to this kind of thing, boycotting and all that, but I definitely feel like closing my amex account for good. Dropping my overall available credit by that much was already a hit to my score I suppose. Even though I don't need to worry about that at the moment, they could be screwing people who need to maintain stable credit scores right now."
CRedit,"***UPDATE:

I just got my FICO scores from myfico.com and they are basically around the same as the Vantage 3.0 score of 577! 

Equifax 584 Fair
TransUnion 572 Poor
Experian 588 Fair

Just wanted to update with this information since I thought it was interesting how close the FICO scores were to my Vantage 3.0 score! ***


Right now I have a 577 Transunion Vantage 3.0 score! Not sure what the others are yet but I plan on ordering the full package on myfico.com! Anyways, by chance I got a unsecured Capital One credit card in March 2020 with a $300 limit then it increased to $400 beginning of July 2020. I also have an unsecured loan ($2,500) from my credit union which because of losing my job due to COVID it was my saving grace (was able to pay rent and other bills with it) until my current job I started May 4th 2020. I have paid both on time and the statement balance on my credit card everytime. I have a 100% payment record for both on my credit report. I also just financed a vehicle ($7,695) on July 22nd but that hasn't shown up yet on my report. After reading this sub I thought getting a Discover IT secured card would be a good addition to what I have and would potentially help my credit score as well. Well, I got denied the secured card. They said they will send me a letter telling me why. Was that a bad idea applying for that card? Should I try another secured card? Or because I have a unsecured card should I just do right by that one until I can get another unsecured card? I guess I am just confused on how to get my credit score better than it is... I know time but I just want to make sure there is not something else out there I should be getting! If so, what should I get? If not, what suggestions do you have for what I currently have to help my score? Thank you in advance for any suggestions and advice!"
CRedit,"I had a paid off 36-month vehicle lease. The lease-end statement was mailed out 2 weeks later with a fee for excessive wear. I already knew the amount by calling in, so I mailed a check the same day to the address the company provided. This was the only payment option for lease end fees, as the balance on the company payment portal reported $0, because the lease itself was already paid in full. Here's where the fun begins:

About 2 months later, I got a credit alert with a 30-day late. I called the company, turns out they never received check #1. They confirmed the address, but suggested a different one would be better, so I immediately mailed check #2 to the new address. I waited 10 days and called back, they don't have check #2 due to some payment processing delays or backlog, and gave me yet another address. I mailed check #3 overnight and put a stop payment on checks #1 and #2. They received #3 and processed the payment, but by this time they reported a 60 day late on my credit. By the way, I got an email notification 45 days later that their system tried and failed to process check #2 (due to the stop payment), even though by this time they had already processed #3.

After spending countless hours on the phone over several months bouncing between useless reps and supervisors, having to mail 2 letters to their credit dispute team explaining the situation, their final verdict is that the payment was indeed late, and my report was updated with the remarks ""dispute resolved, customer disagrees"".

I'm hesitant to dispute this directly with the CRAs because, in my experience, their lazy solution is to delete the entire tradeline rather than spend time correcting inconsistencies. I don't want to wipe out 36 months of good payment history. My questions:

Should I file a CFPB complaint or find a FCRA/FDCPA attorney? One of my cards was closed with the bank citing the credit score drop as the reason. I see 3 recent soft pulls from my other card issuers with ""Account Review Inquiry"" as the description. I'm afraid this could cause a cascade effect if this drops my score even further.

Is it even legal to report fees as part of the auto lease? The lease itself is an installment agreement with equal monthly payments, while the fee is an unexpected, variable, one-time amount that can be many times higher. Here's an example of how Experian shows this scenario:

&amp;#x200B;

|Month|Balance|Scheduled|Paid|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|34|500|250|250|
|35|250|250|250|
|36|0|250|250|
|37|1000|0|0|
|38|1000|0|0|

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
CRedit,"I pulled my scores down from My FICO. These scores are different (800-805) across all three agencies per FICO 8&amp;9 model.

I reviewed the info on each report and everything is exactly the same. The same inquiries, same accounts, same balances, same dates. I cannot find any differences.

Obviously at 800+ the differences don’t matter, But, trying to understand the game here... how is this possible?"
CRedit,"I've been substantially rehabbing my credit, FICO 8 has gone from an average of 480 to an average of 650 over the course of 2020.  I've paid everything on my report that had a balance, and everything I was aware of off of my report.

But I missed one...

Got a collection letter from Portfolio Recovery Associates for a Capital One account for \~$2500.  

Account opened in 2011, bought by them in 2017.  I don't know when it went into collections, but I was BK13 in 2016, so I assume it was after my case was dismissed in 2017.

This is NOT on any of my 3 credit reports.  

I owe the debt, but I want to be careful that paying it doesn't come back and show up on my credit.

Advice on how to proceed is most welcome."
CRedit,"Hi folks,

I am currently transitioning all of my finances away from the credit union (CU) in my old hometown into an online provider, as it no longer makes sense to use the CU from a logistical standpoint. I currently have a checking, savings, and basic credit card (visa) account with that CU. That card has been open since 2013 and is my oldest, active line of credit.

While I haven't used the CU credit card in years since I've gotten other cards, my question is: **will it significantly impact my credit to close the account?**

For reference, my lines of credit/debt are:

* CU credit card (Since 2013)

* Chase Sapphire Preferred (Since 2016)

* Chase Freedom Unlimited (Since 2020, my new daily driver for non-travel payments)

* Student loans (Paid in full as of mid-2019, payments started ~2010)

* No other loans/debt

Per Credit Karma, my score is ~775 (took a slight hit when I opened the second Chase card last month).

**Based on this, is there any reason not to close my old CU credit card? Will closing that line significantly impact my score?**"
CRedit,"So I just got approved for my Discover It Cash Back card about a week ago (waking up this morning to my credit score up 66pts was amazing).

I am normally not a big spender at all, so I wasn’t really worried about what % of my limit I was using because my monthly average spent is like $100-150 and my credit line is $1500/mo.

However, I found out today that I needed new brakes, so there goes $370. Ugh. 

This still only puts my utilization at like 26%, but I’ve seen a lot of debate on here about what % you’re supposed to stay under to best build your credit. 

I have the money, so should I pay off the $370 charge before it posts, or just wait until it posts to pay my entire bill? Thanks!"
CRedit,"I am using the paid FreeCreditReport to monitor my credit. Things are going well and I've found it useful to keep track of my actions and how it is affecting my credit score.

One weird thing is that a few months ago my score dropped 31 points! for no reason that I could see. Then, a week or two later it regained those points. And just a few days ago, my score dropped again, same amount!

I can't seem to figure out why these ""blips"" are on my report and why they seem to be so huge. My wife also goes through similar dips at the same time. 

Any thoughts?"
CRedit,"My first credit inquiry was from mid-July 2018. The card from that inquiry is with American Express and is still open but the inquiry hasn't fallen off of Experian yet. I know that these inquiries stop impacting your score after \~6 months to a year but I was wondering when exactly does the inquiry fall off after two years have elapsed? 

Does it normally take a few weeks after the two years have elapsed or is it usually almost instant? Should I reach out to Experian about this to dispute the inquiry or something?"
CRedit,"A little back story on how I got to where I am. I'm 28 I spent most my life unsure on how to keep up with finances. My family never had good budgeting skills or a good grasp on credit.I didn't have any idea how any of this really worked when I started working on my credit. All I knew was to keep your balance low and make sure the payments were always on time.Which I've always been good at doing, Untill August of last year that is.My job had let me go after 3 years and I was devastated.To make matters worse I had spent the cards I had were near maxed out. I had felt confident enough that I would be able to pay it off quickly because I was picking up extra hours at work. I was able to collect unemployment but it was just enough to cover my monthly expenses. Rent,food,phone,gas and stuff for my kids. For 3 months My cards got put to the back burner. I watched my credit score drop from 698 all the way down to 340 on vantage. In December I was able to finally find steady work and I was able to pay off all of my cards by early February. My credit score is now at 479 on with vantage but my FICO score is showing 557. I have have some pretty hard hitting negative marks on my credit score now is there any way I can get them removed out of good will??"
CRedit," 

I strive to have good credit, however I do have a few marks on my reports that are holding me back.

I  have 2 items in collections (medical bill I believe from when I moved  and an old electric bill I didn’t have the money for after I moved to my  new apartment). I have the money to pay both of them in full but I know  some people have said that once they are in collections, you can  negotiate for a cheaper price. Would that be the case still if I ask if  they will do a pay-for-delete on it? The amount for both in full would  be about $550. I would prefer to pay less if possible and have them  deleted but if I would have better luck getting them deleted by paying  in full, which is fine as well. For electric, it is a total of $290 and  is now with L.J. ROSS &amp; ASSOCIATES and says it was assigned to them  on March 31st, 2020. For the medical bill, it is a total of $261 and is  now with Fidelity Collections, which is right down the road from me  actually. It says it was assigned to them on 10/10/2019. I was on the  phone when I canceled my service with the internet company and I was  never informed that I had to return the equipment back to them (I should  have assumed though) and that I still had an outstanding balance (I  thought I was all up-to-date).

My  other mark on my report is I have two 30-day late payments as well. One  from my auto loan company, Santander, and the other one from my credit  card company, Chase bank on my Chase Freedom card. For Chase, I also  only have one mark as a late payment, December 2019. It was due to me  having to put my dog down and moving and having to pay for a U-Haul and  for the vet cost and cremation. I should be able to find my dog’s death  certificate/certification of cremation, and possibly a receipt from  U-Haul. After those non-regular bills, I did not have enough money to  pay my January payment. I have not missed another payment and always  been on time after that. I do have enough money to pay this off in full  ($4,000), not sure if that will make a difference to Chase or not. I  have a second Chase card and that one I have always been on time and  never missed a payment either. For Santander, I only have one mark for a  late payment and it was my fault. It was also in December 2019 as well  and was due to the same reasons as for Chase bank.

TL;  DR - I am looking for help on how to better my report and remove these  derogatory marks from my account. I have enough money to pay the  collections in full and my chase card off in full as well. I am looking  to start house shopping next year and don’t want these to hold me back  from getting approved."
CRedit,"My CC offered a Coronavirus relief program where you could opt in and they'd defer your payments until the end of July and you could request additional relief time if you could show you had been impacted by the virus (out of work, positive diagnosis, etc.).  


I enrolled. However, things never really got bad for me, so I continued to charge to my card and pay it off at the end of each month.   


Yesterday I submitted my payment and after it went through, this morning I received an email stating that they were increasing my credit limits with them (from $12,300 to $15,000) and thanking me for continued use of my card during this time and making timely payments.  


I welcome increased limits because it reduces my debt ratio and increases my access to funds if needed.  


Anyone else experience this?"
CRedit,"Years ago, my mother got a Best Buy credit card via Citi Bank and added me as ~~an authorized user~~ a joint account holder. ~~I have since been removed as an authorized user.~~ The account has been closed. However, the card is still showing up on Experian. (It's not showing up on Credit Karma.) The card has not been used responsibly (very high credit usage) so it is negatively impacting my credit score.

For example, Experian is showing:

* Credit Usage: 441%
* Total Debt: $6,564

Credit Karma is showing the correct values:

* Credit Usage: 5%
* Total Debt: $1,450

I searched on this subreddit and the answer seemed to be ""Call the credit card company and have yourself completely removed from the account."" So I tried that. I just got off the phone with Citi Bank and they assured me that I have been completely removed from the account. I've tried a dispute on Experian but their response was that the issuing institution verified that the information Experian has regarding the account is correct.

What are my options?

EDIT: The bot asked me to include my credit score.

Credit Karma (VantageScore 3.0):

* TransUnion: 694
* Equifax: 697

Experian (FICO Score 8): 674

EDIT2: Best Buy informed me that I was not an authorized user but a joint account holder. So does this mean the account is going to show up on my report for years to come? Is there nothing I can do?"
CRedit,"My score is around 650 and trending up. Trying to put myself in the best position possible to buy a home.. Have a few collections from 2 - 3 years ago that range from $200 - $800.

CRedit,"For the last year I have been trying to repair my credit. It has been a constant struggle to get my score to where I would like it to be. I am currently sitting at a 633 as of today. I missed several payments on my first two credit cards, resulting in one of them being sent to collections back in November of 2019. I received a phone call from the collection agency the day it got turned over and paid it off right then (less than $2,000). Thereafter, I paid off my second credit card (the account is still open today). In the last 8 months I have opened two new accounts, both have just increased my limit to a mere $500 on each line. I have kept the balance on all three of my open credit cards at $0 (paying it off right after I use them). I also was able to finance a new car, I had to put a heavy down payment since my credit score was pretty low at the time. In an attempt to repair my credit last July I took out a credit building loan from MoneyLion, which was fine until March of this year. I had automatic payments running on it. In March, my payment did not go through on the day scheduled, I called MoneyLion several times telling them that it was processing however they wound up reporting it as a missed payment. I tried disputing on the phone with them multiple times, and then with the credit bureaus. To this day they have not been able to help me whatsoever. Since then, the loan has been paid off completely. So here I am today, I have three credit cards, zero percent usage, average credit age of 10 months, and an auto loan. The missed payments are hurting my credit obviously. I know they will sit idle on my report for up to seven years, which is not sitting well with me. I am not sure what to do in regards to repairing my credit. I am more than willing to utilize a credit repair agency to help, but I am unsure if they would be able to help me with this situation. I have combed through my credit report multiple times, and the only errors I have found was from my younger self being irresponsible with money. I have turned myself around financially in the last 8 months and I understand that I am fully responsible for my current situation. As I mentioned, I am more than willing to have a credit repair company help me get my score back on track, however I am not sure of how long it would take to get my score up. Ideally, I would like to get my score up to a 700, and have the charge off removed, and some of the missed payments (if any) removed from my credit report. Any input into my situation is appreciated!"
CRedit,"Hello everyone! So long story short I don’t have bad credit (around 730-740) at the moment but I want to get it in the 800 range

CRedit,"I signed up on Borrowell a couple months ago when a co-worker recommended them for a free credit score check.

I looked them up and and all seems good, and I confirmed by some quick googling that a credit check won't negatively affect my credit score.

Cool, so I do a credit check, get a score of 812, and I'm happy. I forget about Borrowell. Then I noticed I have tons of emails in my junk folder from Borrowell. ""Updates on your credit report"" and others similar to that.

I decided to look again, and noticed that my score is now 760, from an all time high of 840. 

I pay off my CC in full every month, have never had a late payment or interest charges, and I don't have any debt.

CRedit,"When i was a teenager i went to open a bank account with my father at BOA (highly regretted it ever since)  with a security deposit of $500. I had a bad payment status for 30-59 days and the account was closed by the credit grantor but only after i payed off the balance (**they allowed me to pay off the balance by saying i had to make payment to use the card again and after i did they said i had to call a service representative**) . I should have been more responsible on checking my balance since it was below $500 and thinking back now i was told that even though i payed off the due amount i would not be getting my deposit back, so me being a irresponsible  teenager i just wanted to hide this fact from my parents. Moneys tight right now for my family so i was wondering if there was anyway to recover this $500. Is there any steps i should take to gather information regarding this ie the credit card terms and service before i try to dispute the fact?

CRedit,"Just saw my credit score drop 78 points.  Recently reviewed all three credit reports and they are pristine.  Only blemish was an address that I never lived at.  No late payments, no collections, no public records.  Just bought a house and put 6k on a credit card with an 7.5k limit.  Total credit using is 32%.  The is the scoring on my bank's website so I don't believe it is FICO.  I simulated the impact of paying off the 6k and it gave an 88 point increase.  I guess I don't understand the value of a model that is so volatile, or why my 100% on-time payment would be weighted so much less that credit usage.  Are these just BS models the banks are using?"
CRedit,"Hi,

I'm a 25 year old (730+ credit score) living in Chicago, IL. I recently put in an application for a new apartment, but had the application rejected following a tenant screening which showed three instances of late payments and insufficient funds. I was super confused by this, being I always made payments in-full and on time.

After some investigation and getting in touch with the Property Management company that managed my last apartment, the general ledger for my payment history confirmed *I* made the payments in-full and on time; however, unbeknownst to me, one of my roommates was the tenant making late payments/flagged for insufficient funds.

Is there anything I can do to remedy this? I've already got the general ledger and a letter of recommendation from the property manager, but are there additional steps I can take to fix this on my credit?

I’m drowning in monthly interest.

CRedit,"Hello 👋 So I have one collection account hurting my credit. I signed up for Collection Shield 360 to hopefully get it removed. The agency sent me the paperwork about 3 weeks ago validating the debt which I then uploaded to CS360. About a week after the validation I got a letter from them stating I owe this amount and have 30 days to contact them to dispute it. 

Well I just revived an email from CS360 that the account has been removed which I found strange since they just validated the debt plus sent me a letter with the amount I owe. I double checked other sites I use and sure enough, it was deleted. 

However, my question is- is the account temporarily deleted because they’re waiting the 30 days for me to dispute the account? And if that’s the case, should I pay? I have the money to pay and don’t mind paying it if it stays gone. I don’t want to pay it and then they’re able to put it right back on my report. I know a PIF collection is better than an unpaid collection but I’d rather continue to try to pay for a deletion if possible. 

The letter they sent me doesn’t say anything about having 30 days to pay to avoid it being placed on my credit report which is why I’m concerned that if I do pay it, they’d be able to report it again. 

Thanks for any help!

CRedit,"I was approved for 700 dollars though EasyPay due to some massive car repairs I had to make recently.  I made a payment for 100 dollars before the due date, as I wanted to get ahead and I like to pay off my accounts quickly.  However, the payment was declined, even though I have sufficient funds in my account (I checked).  Now it's saying I have 25 dollars overdue, and I'm really worried as to how this will affect my credit.  How long do you guys think it should take to bounce back from this?"

CRedit,"I have the Discover IT card as my first credit card ever. I’m 23, decent credit before this because I bought a brand new car 2 years ago and paid it off. Also paid off student loans while I was still in school. The limit on the card started around $600 but throughout the year got bumped up to 3050. At the highest I was at about 80-85% utilization. 

“I’m gonna get a credit card and only put gas on it” -famous last words. I did that for about 6 months. Then things came up like a huge vet bill, a plane ticket that I definitely didn’t need, a Xbox, and probably 1/3 of my debt was from buying food to support binge eating disorder.

The discover card had no interest for 12 months, and matches cash back after first year. I just got my cash back match of $116 and applied it. I’ve been pouring every ounce of extra money I have into this card while it has no interest. 

The balance is down to $114 and I’ll be able to pay it off on my next check! it just is starting to earn interest this month (24% why the hell did I accept that lmao) 

My fico credit score never really got that bad - just fell from a 760 to about 710. Now I am back around 760 I think? I will be getting a new statement with updated credit score I can post when it arrives.

Edit: Fico is 755 updated today. : )"
CRedit,"I recently disputed 6 collection accounts on my reports with Transunion, Equifax and Experian (all medical from a few years back). I was successful in having 3 accounts removed from all these reports, which equates to roughly half the debt in terms of dollars. All 3 report scores jumped up 60+ points. However, after about 2 weeks or so, the Transunion score reverted back to within 17 points of the old score; I have no idea why. The disputed debts remain off my report and the other 2 reporting agencies have maintained the point increases following the removals. Why did this happen? Why is it only the Transunion report? The removed debts have not reappeared on any of the 3 reports. I'm puzzled... help?"
CRedit,"I've had this question since March and now that I've run out of my savings I'm thinking it's about time I ask you guys for guidance. 

I came to the US as an international student  at an Ivy on a full-ride but due to being bipolar (got diagnosed in January) I ended up racking up a credit card debt of around 4K on 3 different credit cards. Situation got extremely dire that I had to take a medical leave of absence in March coinciding the exacerbating Covid situation. 

Anyhow I can't see myself getting stable enough to hold a job in the forseeable future to pay even the minimum payments or going back to college - have to pay 10K for leaving during the semester before I can join. I'm back in my home country and can't really ask my parents who basically disowned me a couple of years ago. Living in a shabby one room apartment for now and barely making the ends meet. Would it be fine for me to default especially given that it's highly likely I won't be going back?"
CRedit,"This account is old about two or three years, I sent a validation letter but they sent back a verification letter. And they didn’t include all the information I requested in the validation letter. The information on the verification was correct for the most part.... however the address was my house where I grew up, but when I opened the cc account I used my college address. I found an old statement and found the old mailer when you first get the card, both have my college address. Are either one of these valid options to dispute with cfpb.gov to get the collections removed? 

And yes, I’m just now trying to do something about it... finally got my shit together and trying to rebuild my credit. Thanks in advance!"
CRedit,"Was wondering what I do to boost my credit score up to 700+ or so. I legit have no idea about anything, the only thing I know is to pay it back right after you use your credit card to boost credit

CRedit,"I have two credit accounts for $900 with a 0 balance. Experian says my utilization is 0% on the credit summary. Then on Experian’s credit score simulator, it says a major factor is high utilization at 88%. The language used is “ Ratio of your revolving balances to your credit limits is 88% ” and if I were to pay down $3000 on my “credit cards” my score would go up 50 pts. Just don’t know where to pay this. Does credit card collections count toward utilization of revolving balances? When I do the math it comes out to 81%. I also have closed charged off credit accounts. Do these still count towards utilization?"

I have been pre-approved for a Capital One Secured platinum card. Would it be beneficial to my credit score over the next six months to open this card? I know it can temporarily ding my credit. The goal is to raise my score in the long run, but my most immediate goal is to continue to raise it enough by January to be able to rent an apartment. So, I wanted to see if it's best to stick with my recently opened Open Sky card and build between now and then, and then open the credit card after I move into my new apartment, or open an additional card now to help increase my rebuild potential.

CRedit,"My credit report was showing a credit card that i paid off in 2018 as derogatory. I just contacted the creditor to make sure i paid it and i didnt miss it (or imagine it). It was in fact, paid off March 2018. I have a couple questions. 

I filed a dispute with experian, but what is the best way to go about this? I can write them a letter asking them to remove it but im not sure which will take longer or be more efficient. I dont want experian to come back and tell me to write a letter when i can just do that now. Or should i do both?

Is this effecting my on-time payments? It just decreased 1% but i didnt miss payments on anything. 

When it is removed, is my credit score going to increase, and if so, does it go back 2 years since it was paid off that long ago? 

Thanks in advance. Ive been working really hard to pay off my old stuff and fix my life so i can buy a house."
CRedit,I had clinic send my bill to collections. I paid the clinic directly and no longer owe anything to clinic. About 8 months later the collections shows up and affects my credit score. What happens to the collections
CRedit,"My situation is that I was building decent credit in my early 20s but ended up in credit debt hell when i became unemployed and didnt have finances or anyone to help me. (I've been on my own since I was 16.) As I tried to clawed my way out  I literally gave up on credit because I had collection letters piled up and unopened. Fast forward, I'm now 40. I managed to work my way into a decent middle class job. However, I had been REALLY afraid of  dealing with my credit life. I have exclusively used a debit card for the past 15 years.

 Now I have a second chance. My credit is reset. I literally have no FICO score. I get this free through NFCU, but nothing populates and the message is that it cant be generated because i have too short history/not enough credit or I am believed to be dead. I 'm serious. Anyway,  during covid19, Ive had more time to just think because I have one big goal - a home purchase. I've been watching youtube videos and this channel. I have done a few things so far -

1. 5 months ago - Opened up an account and my first secured visa cc with NFCU. 100% on time payments for 5 months and credit karma is showing me with a vantage score of 702 and 708 as of today which is based on this one account

2. This month - I opened up a  Self credit building loan which will begin taking money $48 next month for a 12 month period. (It cost me $9 upfront with some fees along the way but ill get most of my money back). No hard pull for this.

3. This month - took out a small secured loan from my Golden1 credit union  against a CD. I've set this to autopay monthly from my checking on the same day as the other loan. Hard pull on my account.

4. This month - Discover Secured. Applied for and provided $1000 for the card which will be here next week. Hard pull on my account.

5. This month -  Went to the credit union listed in #3 and set up $500 with their secured product, a Mastercard. No hard pull because they used the same one for my secured loan.


In total, this will be 3 revolving cards and 2 installments. I'm very serious about building and adding mix. The loan officer at the credit union told me I am trying to do too much in too short a timeframe and should have waited for 6 months. 

I know I've done a lot this month, but I tried to do some logical planning. I've added 4 items, but I've only taken 2 hard pulls.  Self doesnt  do a hard pull. With one of my credit unions, i was able to consolidate two products with one hard pull because it was in a 3 month period. I also picked secured cards with no annual fee so I can be comfortable keeping them and my credit age forever even if they wont be primary down the line.

 I wanted to pack these all together so I dont reduce the age of my credit by adding some of these piece meal 6 months from now.  I have NO plan or desire to add anything else over the next year. I'm going to maintain and pay all the cards to 10% utilization both loans are autopay. 

Does my plan  make sense? or is there some reason it is bad I added too many  new accounts at the same time. Is the hit to my new credit going to be worse for doing this than if i had spread it out more? What else would you recommend for someone in my position? What would you have done differently?"
CRedit,I received an old light bill that I thought I paid they said I had 30 days before they add it to my credit so i called same day I received it and paid it. It was never on my credit and then 30 days later they reported a charge off then reported again stating charge off paid all in the same day... this took me down 35 points and i been working really hard the past 5 years to get my family in a home I need your help how can I get this removed? Or any advise on what to do. Thanks in advance.
CRedit,I have a discover card that i usually never max out and never miss a payment i do use it regularly.. i recently had a capital one card go into collections will discover see that and close my account ?
CRedit,"Firstly thank you all for helping me through this process. 

I'm currently in the process of buying a home using my VA loan. I have little education on credit / credit use but I've been doing countless research since I began mortgage shopping. I could have sworn up and down that I had good credit but I didn't know about the '30%' credit utilization. Long story short I paid down my debt from owing 60% to 18%.

After reviewing my credit report (one that I received from a potential lender one mortgage shopping)  I noticed a few items in bold.

Best Buy/CBNA - Closed - amount owed $625 - 1 late remark 2015 - this account is current I make all monthly payments I can also pay this off. 

Verizon - Collection - amount owed $529 - this was for equipment that we already returned we have the receipt and everything and were told it was going to be taken out of collection, obviously it didn't. 

Dept of VA - Collection - Amount owed $125 - this was an over payment that I honestly don't even remember ever getting. I just got off the phone with the VA and they have an old address on file which explains why I haven't seen this. Apparently the debt is with the Treasury department now not the VA.


Comenity/Boscovs (department store) - amount owed $0 - 4 late payment remarks. 3 of them are 5/2016, 8/2016, and 5/2017 30-59 days late and 1 of them 9/2016 is for 60-89 days late. This account has been paid off and not used in over 2 years. 

Conserve (a collection agency used by my University) - Amount owed $0 status reads 'Paid Collection' 

My credit score should be at a 640 (fico) with my debt paid down from 60% to 18%, but I want to be at a higher score so I can get better rates. A different lender mentioned a credit repair agency, but everyone on the subreddit seems to hates these agencies. I have the money to pay the debt on the Best buy and VA loan but my lender told me not to do so just yet because it might reflect negatively on my credit. Would it be the same if I write pay for deletion letters? Given my time crunch it'll probably be faster if I pay an agency or someone to do it for me are there any recommendations? Is this something I can realistically do myself? I'm really anxious and would rather get approved with better interest rates than just get approved if that makes any sense.


I'm definitely learning my lesson the hard way

**Update #1** 

Thank you all for your help and advice with this. 

I started doing this on my own and here's how far I've gotten. 

Best Buy - agreed to remove the late payments. They said it'll take about a month to reflect. About 45 min on the phone- Will update in 30 days

Verizon - LITERALLY THE WORST TO DEAL WITH !  But ! They admitted and noticed they messed up and will be removing this off my credit. About 2-3 hours of being transferred between the same two departments. - Will update in 30 days 

Conserve - I gave conserve a call and they stated that they don't remove collections from credit reports. The lady was really rude so I decided to just call my college. I guess everybody's having issues with billing just to get in contact with an agent it took two and a half hours He then placed me on hold for 45 minutes to give me someone else's phone number and email address. I sent the person an email and they actually responded I just responded before updating this post  hopefully they respond by tomorrow and I will update then. 

Comenity/Boscovs - The agent who I spoke to was willing to take off the remarks but when he went into my account he noticed that they were from before 2018 and said he doesn't have access to remove these. He did say to send a Goodwill letter to them and they will remove it. This is what the representative told me. I'm going to try and give them a call tomorrow and see if I get the same information from someone else before writing a letter or to see if I get someone like I did with Best buy who's willing to take it off for me. - will update tomorrow

VA - haven't tried to call them yet. I'm going to try the whole paid to delete thing. Being that the treasury department has this collection I don't think I will get very far, but I will keep you all posted."
CRedit,"I have brought my credit up to around 700 in the last year or so after a long bout with debt issues. I can't seem to get my credit above that 740+ mark. I think the main issue is lack of open accounts. My question is: In about a year, I would like to start looking at buying a home. If I take out another credit card(or 2) now, will it hurt or help?"
CRedit,"
So I messed up. I applied and was approved for a Capital One Platinum card. However, I think I applied too soon. My Discover card just graduated last week after 7 months with a $2k credit limit increase. However, that isn't reflected on my credit report. It's still showing as a $200 secured card. Therefore Cap One only approved me for a $300 limit. My Fico 8 TU score is 738 and my Experian is 702. I have no derogatories on my report, the only thing there is just the Discover card and I wanted a second card to boost my score since my credit history is limited. Should I just wait six months and ask for a CLI or should I wait until my credit report reflects the new Discover graduation and call and ask for a CLI increase? I wanna make the hard pull worth it and not have another card that I'm maxing out and paying down once a week.  
Credit limit increase"
CRedit,"I finally just paid off all of my debt (collections, credit card) with the exception of my student loans. I was able to get my credit score to 649 (Vantage Score per Credit Karma). As of now, I only have a Cap One card that I paid down to $0, but my understanding from threads in here was to use that card and pay it off in full before the due date for credit utilization purposes. 

I made some charges (contact lenses, cell phone bill and an Amazon order). My statement date isn’t until August 12 so I was going to pay it this week (I already did) but my credit score DROPPED 66 points because of the balance.

Why would this happen before the statement date? It just updated last week. Cap One told me they only report once a month. I’m so confused.

What am I doing wrong? Is it better to only buy gum (small purchases) with the card? 

I feel so defeated. I worked hard to get my credit score back up so I can possibly apply for a Discover secured card and now it’s back down again."
CRedit,"Short story: I was a month late on a payment which I thought I had paid. I must not have clicked through all the screens to confirm online payment, so yes it is on me but when I discovered the error in the next month I paid both months (usual minimum is 50 but I pay 80) and also an extra $100. But because of the delinquent month they lowered my credit limit from $3800 to $2650, and as a result my credit score dropped 13 points. Do I have any standing to contest this or do I just suck it up and move on?"
CRedit,"Just got the alert that a collection agency has reported $157.00 on two of the credit bureau . My wife ""may"" had gone to perform ultrasound during the pregnancy last year. Now, seems like they have reported the remaining balance. I have few questions as below.

It was for my wife's ultrasound, but they have reported for both of us. My wife, and myself (spouse). Can they do this? I never consented or signed any documents when we have gone for ultrasound. The only thing is I am the prime member of the health insurance.

We went to the one of the biggest hospital in the New Jersey. The hospital has billed us also for the same day, but may be for different codes (may be for providing facility), and the charges which has been reported are for the doctor. When we went to do ultrasound, we thought it will be treated by the hospital but this charges are for a private group who may be providing services inside the hospital. Do we have any legit reason to dispute this claims?

Also, the doctor may have billed as an Out-Of-Network, however, when we went to the hospital, they told us you are in-network and we will bill you as in-network.

As the amount is not a huge, I am OK to pay $157.00 to settle this. However, I would like to know, if anyway I can push the collection agency to completely delete this entries from the credit bureau as I have read that it is vary rare that the collection agency will agree for ""Pay For Delete"".

Edit: I would like to add that the collection date has been written as 03/26/2020. However, the dates of treatments of ultrasounds are from 05/2019 and 08/2020. Can I also dispute this charges with credit bureau on the basis of wrong date?

Edit 2: I just spoke with the collection agency, and the representative told me that once you pay it, it will be deleted from the credit bureau and after 7 to 10 business days, it will not show on the report. But she refused to give me in writing this. She said, we are on the recorded line and I am repeating that it will not show as paid and it will disappear from the credit bureau but I cannot give it in writing. Does it really work this way? If this thing really works? I search everywhere and never found that they will delete it unless it's signed on ""Pay for Delete"" letter.

CRedit,I've seen posts talking about going with a Credit Union vs just a regular known bank and wanted to know what's the reason behind it and is it really any different than what I should expect from a regular bank? Is it helpful to me in anyway in terms of credit or any good come out of having an account with one? I'm in NYC btw so I do see there's plenty of Credit Union banks but not sure if which one seems right or if there's any point to them. Appreciate any insight you guys have for me.
CRedit,I've been trying to fix my credit by paying things off as I'm wanting to buy a house sooner than later. I had a credit card account that had gone into collections that had a balance of $384. The collection company said I could settle for $230 so I paid it. Now it's showing on my report closed/charged off as bad debt profit and loss write off with balance of $154. Did I actually hurt myself paying it? Especially since in 7 months it could've possibly fallen off. Of course everything was done over the phone and I have no paperwork for it.
CRedit,"Hello everyone, 

I've been in the US for a little over a year now. I've never gone a month without paying my card in full. By the time I was issued a score it was 756 (FICO) so I applied for a new card in June and my score dipped to 738, and in a second beaureau it was 712. I got my new card, splitting purchases between the two, then today my score dipped another 16 points for some reason, while the other bureau dipped by 3 points. I hadn't applied to anything, my two statements are $0, so I'm not sure what happened. 
I will list down a few things that changed during that time:

1-I moved to a new place, hated the commute, and moved to another place all within a month. 

2- I made a $550 purchase on one card, paid it off immediately (my credit limit is $2700). I had made similar purchases before when I only had 1k limit, and they never hurt my credit score. 

3- I took the bus to and from work, buying tickets with my card. 

4- I applied for an appartment, but I can't see an inquiry on my file.

I'm trying to build a credit history, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong?"
CRedit,"I strive to have good credit, however I do have a few marks on my reports that are holding me back. 

I have 2 items in collections (medical bill I believe from when I moved and an old electric bill I didn’t have the money for after I moved to my new apartment). I have the money to pay both of them in full but I know some people have said that once they are in collections, you can negotiate for a cheaper price. Would that be the case still if I ask if they will do a pay-for-delete on it? The amount for both in full would be about $550. I would prefer to pay less if possible and have them deleted but if I would have better luck getting them deleted by paying in full, which is fine as well. For electric, it is a total of $290 and is now with L.J. ROSS &amp; ASSOCIATES and says it was assigned to them on March 31st, 2020. For the medical bill, it is a total of $261 and is now with Fidelity Collections, which is right down the road from me actually. It says it was assigned to them on 10/10/2019. I was on the phone when I canceled my service with the internet company and I was never informed that I had to return the equipment back to them (I should have assumed though) and that I still had an outstanding balance (I thought I was all up-to-date). 

My other mark on my report is I have two 30-day late payments as well. One from my auto loan company, Santander, and the other one from my credit card company, Chase bank on my Chase Freedom card.
For Chase, I also only have one mark as a late payment, December 2019. It was due to me having to put my dog down and moving and having to pay for a U-Haul and for the vet cost and cremation. I should be able to find my dog’s death certificate/certification of cremation, and possibly a receipt from U-Haul. After those non-regular bills, I did not have enough money to pay my January payment. I have not missed another payment and always been on time after that. I do have enough money to pay this off in full ($4,000), not sure if that will make a difference to Chase or not. I have a second Chase card and that one I have always been on time and never missed a payment either. 
For Santander, I only have one mark for a late payment and it was my fault. It was also in December 2019 as well and was due to the same reasons as for Chase bank.

TL; DR - I am looking for help on how to better my report and remove these derogatory marks from my account. I have enough money to pay the collections in full and my chase card off in full as well. I am looking to start house shopping next year and don’t want these to hold me back from getting approved."

CRedit,"Hello,

I have had a Discover Secured Card for a year and a half. I had a few months where I had late/returned payments, so I understood that I would not graduate immediately. I was told by Discover to pay the entire statement so that I would have a 0 balance by cycle date. Did that, noticed my FICO scores were not moving. Called again a few months later, was then told to have a small amount that shows you are using the credit available, but can pay it off by due date/cycle date. I have kept statement balances at 10% across my cards for months, but still no graduation.

I'm then told this weekend by Discover that I can't spend more than 30% of what's on the card (even though they were limited on what they could actually tell me besides the general ""Pay your bills on time and keep balances &lt;30%""). So, even though I have a $500 limit, I can only spend $150 in a given month on that card. I use my cards to pay for bills and I make two payments on my cards monthly (one before the due date, and one before the cycle date) to make sure the CRA's show a low utilization and balance.

Does anyone that has had a graduated Discover card have any advice? I have had late payments (unaware that paying by cycle date still counts as late because it's three days after due date), but never missed, so no 30's/60's on my cards. Last ""late"" payment was April '20.

Update: Talked to Discover twice today, with different reps. One said I could not use more than $150 on the card PERIOD per month, the other said you can use as much of the balance as you want, as long as the statement balance is &lt;30%. This was within 5 minutes of each other in different call centers.  Someone plz help, thx..."
CRedit,"I know a hard inquiry on your credit can lower your credit score. I was, if my score is 720 and an auto or mortgage company checks my credit, does that hard inquiry show them 720, and then my score will drop a few points since it was checked. So the next person who sees my score will show that lower score. Or does the act of the inquiry cause the score to drop so while it may be 720, they will see 710 or 715 because they are inquiring.

Asking because I am right on the bubble for a jumbo Loan with a 720 credit minimum. (I have a 720) and wondering if all things held equal they will see 720, or they will see lower because of the inquiry they place to check it.

What are the best legit catalogues to build credit?"
CRedit,"I had a Total VISA card through The Bank of Mo that was charged off and (supposedly) sold. The company it was sold to has no record of this account. I keep calling and being passed between both the original creditor and the new creditor with no way to pay this debt.

I’ve tried disputing and even reached out to Equifax for some guidance on this matter, yet no one can help me get this collection resolved or removed.

Can anyone here give me some advice??"
CRedit,"Hi'

So i'm self employed earning £18 000 a year, I was doing a soft search on ClearScore, Experian, CreditKarma (Vantage Credit score) and all cards have a 0 eligibility rating for me to get approved, excepting this one card named ""Origin"" to which I have 95% eligibility rate.


https://www.origincreditcard.co.uk/

It is lowly rated, can't find that much about it but anyway... Does anyone have/use this card to successfully improve their credit score, is it any good?

I don't have any credit history at all, no debts/bad history, just came a year ago to the Uk.
This card seems like my only option to start building credit.

Thanks!"
CRedit,My FICO score currently is 599; not great but 100 points over where it used to be a couple months ago. I have a secured card through Capital One with a $200 limit that I got approved for in June but it’s not showing on my reports yet (guessing because the first payment is in August). What do you guys think is the time to get another card? I’m thinking another secured card would be best and I’m thinking either the Discover one or one through Bank of America because I have a debit account with them. My credit usage on the CO card is less than 30% and I’ve been paying the charges off as they clear so I’ve already made the minimum payment that would’ve been due in August. Should I apply for the BOA card now since there isn’t a card showing on my report or wait until later this year like September?
CRedit,"Im looking to get a car loan (30k) my credit was bad I had a credit card of 200 and a at&amp;t bill of 100 both go to collections both were paid off like almost a year ago, opened and paid off a small loan of 500 to help boost back my credit. It’s now at 655 and 633 based off credit karma ( I’ve read ck is not too accurate) what are my approval odds? Is there something I can do to boost my credit fast before trying to get a loan?"
CRedit,"Years ago I had my information posted to the dark web and several people went car shopping (a couple actually got cars) on my info.  


They were even smart enough to have my mail held (vacation hold) so I wouldn't get the credit letters in the mail until too late.  


Fortunately, none of that worked and none of the charges ever hit my credit. Also, an extended credit fraud alert was placed on my file at no charge. That's great, but I don't know how to have it removed.  


I'd rather do what my wife has, she simply pays $10 to have her credit 'unlocked' briefly.  


How do I go about getting an extended credit fraud alert removed from my account. I've tried calling TransUnion and Experian, but was on hold so long I had to hang up."
CRedit,"So basically I owed a college some money. The school called me &amp; said I could set up a payment plan. They gave me a date I had to set it up by. I did as instructed and I STILL got sent to collections.

I’ve been paying the college monthly for the past few months but given they already sent the account to collections, what do I do? I tried to dispute the outstanding debt but it did not get removed. Should I try to dispute again? Should I still make payments to the college? Have I been throwing money away?"
CRedit,Hey guys I was an authorized user back when I was in high school and the person who gave me the credit card has used the card an awful lot. (I no longer have a card)It has affected my credit score as I’m always making payments on time and have a low credit utilization. My question is how can I remove myself off of the account associated with the card? Do I simply dispute it? (Get my credit score from credit karma)
CRedit,"Hello, I am a 21 yo law student currently without any loan debt, with an ability to pay the remaining balance of tuition for the next semester with funds from my summer job. I have one credit card with no balance remaining and I have paid off two accounts in collections for medical expenses and seen a slight bump in my credit score. Because I had those accounts for a few months, my FICO credit score is sitting at 606. Because of this, I have two very poor credit card options (28%+APR) and one personal loan option (8k at a high interest rate) available according to Credit Karma.

My main q is: should I take out a personal for 8k at the high interest rate to pay part of my tuition when I have it already available in cash on hand? Would it increase my score to take out the loan and then instantly pay it back, or would it have no effect?"
CRedit,"Hello,


I want to use my VA loan for a house next year and have been cleaning up my credit. I had some questions about closed credit cards. 

Back Story:

I have nine closed credit cards. They all have a balance. Two were closed by the creditors b/c they went under. I closed seven in 2018 because I had too much debt and credit cards. The seven I closed, I talked to the creditors directly and joined their hardship programs/customer assistance plan. I pay interest on three cards Barclay, Comenity, and Home Credit. 

I wanted to know does closed credit cards with balance affect your utilization? 

For the ones with low balances that I plan to pay off soon. Should I have them removed once paid? 

For the ones that were closed because the companies are defunct, should I try to settle with them vs. paying the full balance off? 

Thank you in advance for your reply."

CRedit,"About two years ago while I was in the military I was arrested and discharged with a less then honorable discharge and I spent about a year in prison when I got out I found out that I had a report that I owed money to the military about 2,700 dollars in total I just now realized this because I just got a letter from a collection agency that is charging me the 2,700 plus an extra 800$ for admin fees now the thing that is bugging me is I have no idea why I have debt as I hired my own lawyer and my pay was cut off when I was arrested now typically the government tends to overpay the military member and when they realize the mistake they take the entire total out of your next pay check but this usually only applies when your getting travel pay or hazardous pay so I have been thinking I should dispute the charge seeing as I have no evidence of having been over paid or any way to prove that I made an error I was wondering if anyone had any advice or insight on how to resolve this issue"
CRedit,"So I recently opened up a dispute for a product I ordered back in February and never received. I know it's super late to dispute it but it was pretty well damn impossible to reach Chase to dispute it due to tremendous phone wait times because of Covid. 

The week after I did so my credit scores dropped about 20 points across all 3 from around ~750 to ~730 (I use Credit Karma for the TransUnion and Equifax, and Amex for Equifax). 

I checked the full credit report on the TransUnion and it says there's a remark on my Chase account. The remark says the following ""Account information disputed by consumer, meets FCRA requirements""

Besides that nothing else has changed except one of my other cards had a statement balance of like $40 more than last time but my total utilization is still under 10% so it can't be that. 

Am I crazy or did my credit really just drop because I opened up a dispute? Will it jump back up after the dispute closes? Out of curiosity, will it matter if I win or lose the dispute? Can losing the dispute for some reason hurt my credit score further? 

This is the first time I ever dispute something on this card after 2 years of owning it and find it ridiculous that this could affect me negatively.

Thank you in advance for any help.

EDIT: Figured it out. I called Chase to confirm this and like kcubby2 said below in a comment, pretty much what happens is that your credit card that you're disputing the transaction on will temporarily be removed from your credit history. Therefore your credit history might be shorter like in my case as that's my longest held card and also the card with the most credit. Either way, once the dispute is settled it'll be counted again and my score should bounce back up."
CRedit,"TL;DR I had E.R. visit that was never filed to insurance. I ignored it, and now collections dropped my Credit Score.

List of facts. 

1. I am an F-1 student. W/ UnitedHealthGroup insurance
   1. I have a full-ride scholarship, sleeping in a car.
   2. 3k in savings and no income. My family can't help me.
   3. No unemployment nor stimulus check.
2. Apr 2019 a friend drove me to E.R. cuz I thought I had a stress fractured rib. 
   1. X-ray showed a muscle cramp. I was given some pain killers and sent home.
   2. Hospital claimed *""insurance didn't recognize me""*, when I gave the hospital my insurance card.
   3. Sep 2019 hospital misspelled my DOB, first and middle name. **They billed me $9,000 for 4 hour visit.**
   4. 11 Phone calls never got me anywhere. 
   5. I fixed my name, DOB and insurance info hospital (then collections).
   6. I ignored hospital's mail out of frustration.
3. 2020 Feb. Collections misspelled my DOB and name. I have mail proof.
   1. Insurance claim *""it's not our problem""* from phone calls with customer support. 
   2. Hospital/Collections claim *""I don't have active insurance with my specific DOB, name, group ID and Account Number""*
   3. Depression, school pressure made me think ""maybe if I ignore it, it'll go away."" I had one month to contest it with the credit Beauru, but I fucked up. *No shaming please!* 
4. 2020 July. I have a collections bill for $2,000is and my FICO score is 580. No lawsuits (sofar?)
   1. I have one credit card with $1,000 limit and was late to a single payment but currently it is paid off. 
   2. It's partially my fault I waited this long. I am alone in a foreign country but I'm also an idiot! 
   3. I can't afford to pay 2/3 of my liquid cash for a 4 hour visit. I am 2 classes away from graduating and am looking for jobs in the states. 
   4. I fear my credit report might make me look bad to potential employers?

CRedit,"It’d be my first card - and there’s things on both sites that would make having a credit card with them useful in building my credit.  

But is that smarter than just opening a normal credit card and using it for gasoline or my car insurance? 

Was also considering getting something at Aaron’s or RentACenter.   

Starting your credit seems horrifically difficult and they need to teach kids in school more about it..."
CRedit,I was wondering if I take a personal loan out and pay for my credit debt which is about 7000$ between two credit cards and just do my payments on the loan if it would be a good idea ?

CRedit,"My roommate and I moved out of our apartment in Texas at the end of June because the property manager failed to repair the apartment which had mold in the vents. The property manager is now charging us 30 days of rent after the day we terminated the lease even though they violated our lease by not making repairs which nulls the need for a thirty day notice. They also already did a walkthrough of the apartment, they already have our keys, and the apartment is completely clean and empty. The property manager is refusing to end our lease and is sending our account balance to collections if we don't pay. How do I save my credit score without getting unrightfully overcharged by the landlord (Berkshire communities). 

Additional info: Since April, we followed all the proper procedure of letting them know about the problem, asking them to fix it and giving them months to fix it/move us into another apartment. This never happened. Therefore we asked to terminate the lease and move out. They said we couldn't move out without giving a 30 days notice.. we said fine here's a 30 day notice but then we read in the lease that we can terminate immediately if timely repairs are not made. This was all communicated through email as well. Please help!"
CRedit,"Hey CRedit,

So I'm in the process of buying a house (using VA loan). I'm currently mortgage shopping and for some reason so.e lenders were approving me and others were not. I was told this is because my revolving credit. I have a total credit limit (all my card added together) of $16k I was using a little bit less than 10k. I was given a break out of all my debt and was told to pay off one cc (about 4k) and pay $700 torwards a different CC. 

I already did the above 


My question is what's their goal? Is it to get my credit utilization down to 30%? If so why not give me an entire breakout paying down all my credit cards to equate to 30% rather than just two credit cards.

In desperation I paid down about 7500-8k worth of credit card debt. There's nothing else wrong or negative on my credit just a higher CC usage. I have to call the lender tomorrow and show them proof that everything has posted showing the new balance. I read somewhere a long time ago when I was looking into consolidating my debt into a loan that if you pay off all your credit card abruptly it'll lower your credit score rather than raise it because it flags fraud. Do you think that I will have a problem with this?"
CRedit,How long does it take for a hard pull to show up on your credit score?  I had a hard pull to apply for a mortgage and I also had a hard pull getting approved for a CSP in the last 2 weeks.  My Discover FICO score updated today and it shows zero inquiries.
CRedit,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for a long time and while I have a good credit history and a few open cards, she does not have a credit card or any credit history. We were talking the other day and the idea came up of me adding her as an authorized user on one of my cards. I plan on marrying her some day so our finances will eventually be combined assuming that goes according to plan. 

So my question is what would be the possible downsides for me of adding her to one of my cards? Could this negatively impact my credit in any way? I am planning on looking into it more and having more conversations about it in the future, this is just the start of the process and I do not plan on making this decision without putting a ton of thought into it."
CRedit,"Can a hospital or debt collector be asked not to report a medical debt to the 3 credit bureaus when someone settles the debt for less than the original amount? I have a veteran with a 6,300 medical debt and he can't afford to pay it in full but wants to settle the debt. He is wanting to offer 1,300 dollars to settle the debt. I advised him of the possibility of them reporting it on his credit report as a negative mark."
CRedit,"I'm about @ 40% for my cards usage. I try to follow the rules of not using over 50% of your cards limit. 

Now, can I request a credit limit increase on this account in order to make it seem like I'm using less of it. 

For example, say I have a limit of 5000 and currently use 2000. Will increasing it to say 7500 make my credit look better? 

If this is a possibility what are the pros or cons?"
CRedit,"Had a charge off 4 years ago. Ever since then I haven’t missed a payment, got a car loan, have over 9 credit cards/ accounts. Have i dont everything i can to fix my credit? Currently at 718 TU 714 EQ and 699 EX. 
What else could I do or is it time to just wait the 3 years so that charge off falls off and my credit goes to 750+?"
CRedit,"So I got a first card, and was wondering if there was a optimal time or method to pay off your statement each month. I only charge to the card when I have enough money, but want to know if paying it off a certain way is better for your credit score.

Right now, when I get the statement, I just pay it off in full.

I’ve heard that if you pay half of your statement 15 days before the due date, and the other half 3 days before the due date, it helps you score. Is there any truth to that?

Or are here other tips on best time to pay it off?"
CRedit,"I’m sure many of you are familiar with (Fingerhut.com). I understand that they offer you a line of credit to shop their catalog. It’s also clear that they charge higher prices on all their goods, in order to widen their profit margins.

Supply Question:
I’m curious though, do they wholesale purchase from suppliers and store them in a warehouse? How do they have so many expensive brands and items in their catalog?

Financial Model Question:
Where does most of their profit come from? I’m assuming a lot of accounts become delinquent, meaning they have to sell the debt. They must be getting their inventory for a really low price, right?"
CRedit,So I been working on fixing and increasing my credit score to buy a home and I was just about there when an old light bill popped up from a previous apartment that I completely forgot about stating they are going to send to collections if I don’t pay it. so I did right away and I guess the light company closed my account and my score drops 35 points is this temporary or am I out of luck?
CRedit,"My dad bought me stuff from swiss colony for Christmas last year, and then I saw that I owed them money. On the fedex delivery page, it showed me as a Mr. but I'm a woman, and when I called them they told me don't worry about the bill, well now I see I have a hard inquiry on my credit score, from swiss colony. I will be calling them tomorrow, but have any of you had this happen before? I know Swiss colony does the credit card pull thing when you get a credit account with them, which my dad did, its kind of like stone berry or finger hut, pay in increments over time. There is no way I can fix this with my dad either

CRedit,"I’ve been slowly rebuilding my credit after a bankruptcy years ago; only had credit cards for about the last year. I’ve gotten it up into the 730s from the 600s in about a year’s time, and I want to get it up into the 800s. I use CreditKarma to track my score - I know it’s not perfect, but it’s free.

Right now, I have two cards - one secured, one not - that I use as cash and pay off pretty much as soon as the purchases post. The utilization is typically very low as a result, but my score keeps fluctuating by a few points based on when it’s checked if there’s been a large purchase. My credit history is short. Is there’re anything I can actively do to raise my score into the 800s, or do I just have to wait and have a longer history?"
CRedit,The last year or so I’ve been rebuilding my credit. Paying off derogatory files. Making all my payments on time. My score has gone from the low 500 to 667. I have two CC. A card with limit around 1000 bucks. I have another card that was 500 and I just upped the limit to 1000. I’m thinking of applying for another card through the credit karma app. It has a lower interest rates so I would transfer my balance to it to save a couple bucks. I’m wondering if it would affect my score. I already have many inquiries on my report because of searching for financing for a car last year. Just looking for a bit of advice here. TIA.
CRedit,"About 6 years ago I made a purchase I couldn't afford.  About about a year and a half of late payments I was  forced to changed jobs and ended up making even less and stopped paying all together...  3 months after I attempted to restarted payments and they told me I was charged off and couldn't pay unless it was the full amount, so i just focused on other things and let it go.

It shows as a charge-off currently on my credit reports.

Fast forward 5 years and I have new established job and better income.  I have been working on clearing up my credit and this is the last thing to address. 

I now have the money to pay it off and have thought about how, or if I could or should, negotiate a payoff.  Is this even a possibility?   

In the end, its been a Hard Lesson learned."
CRedit,"This may seem like a stupid question, but how do federal student loans appear on your credit? I realize you’re responsible for them as any other debt, but how do they factor into things like DTI if you don’t have any required payment until you graduate?

I plan on settling those collections accounts ASAP. I mean, right?

Any help is appreciated."
CRedit,"So I am a student (19F) and I recently got my first credit card to build some credit since I don’t have any. It is the student discover credit card with the 5% cash back and 5% cash back extra during certain months for certain things like this month you get extra if you use it at restaurants and use PayPal. Also I don’t have to pay interest for the first 6 months. 

Now I have a $1000 limit and I’m not going to use all that money because that would be dumb of me. I plan on using at most maybe $100 because I’m scared. I know what it’s like to not have money being from a somewhat poor family as in we are barely middle class.

So with the credit card how can I build my credit even more. I’m open to all suggestions since with the career path I’m choosing I know in about four years I’ll have to take our loans (law school). I would like to build up as much credit that I can in about four years. Since my finical aid is paying for my 4-year degree.

Any suggestion is welcomed. Thank you"
CRedit,"Hello,

I've lurked on CRedit for a long time and have been really grateful for the advice here, but am using a burner account for this post.

I immigrated to this country three years ago for grad school and since then have been steadily building my credit (thanks in part to this sub!). I now have three student loans, four credit cards (including a Chase Sapphire Reserve) and a charge card (AmEx Gold). I had been making on-time payments for all my cards; my student loans are currently in deferral since I just graduated. By this spring, my credit score had reached 756.

I just checked my Creditwise account and it seems that in June, my credit score dropped 50+ points in one move: to \~695. I didn't miss any payments or initiate any hard inquiries. The only thing I can think of is that, in May, one of oldest credit cards had emailed me to inform me that they were decreasing my credit limit (from $2500 to $300) due to ""lack of use."" This is a Deserve credit card (aimed at international students with no SSN) that I had used to build up my credit earlier. But since the card had barely any credit card benefits, I moved my spending to other cards such as the Amex Gold or the Sapphire Reserve.

I now realize that I should have put some recurring expense on my Deserve card anyway (like a monthly subscription). I regret not doing that.

What can I do from here? Does a decrease in credit limit cause such a *drastic* decrease in credit score? (50+ points!) Could I apologetically ask Deserve for restoring my earlier credit limit?

Separately, my current credit score is 699: how bad is it compared to 750+? I ask because I'm going to buy an engagement ring for my SO soon and was hoping to get the retail store's credit card because that would help me save money on the ring."
CRedit,"So I want to know my more accurate credit scores and Experian seems to be the most accurate while Transunion and Equifax have my scores about 40 points higher. I can do the 7 day free trial for all 3 scores but my question is, does anyone actually pay monthly to see their fico scores? Is it kind of a waste to check that often? I'm on the fence about it. I need to build my credit a little higher and longer to get where I want. I just don't knownif it's worth it to pay monthy. Any help or advice?"
CRedit,Will they go on my credit report as on time payments?
CRedit,"My car loan is the oldest thing on my credit report, from 2018. When I got it I had zero credit and the interest rate is 7-8%, my current FICO score is 692, and I want to refinance to get a lower car payment than the $200.00 a month so that I can pay it off faster. But I do know that closing your oldest account can reflect badly. I’ve been planning on doing it next month, when the original inquiries for it go off my credit report but now I’m not sure. Also, for additional info I have a credit card (not overdue or anything) that I took out about four months ago. Is is worth it to get a lower interest rate if it’s going to ding my credit/ will it have a big impact?"
CRedit,What is the purpose of inquires and why do they hurt your credit score? It seems bad to punished people trying to apply for a card.

CRedit,"I took out a personal loan back in 2014 and in 2015 was unable to keep up with my payments and I rearranged my payment plan so the lender reported me as Arrangement to Pay (AP). From 11/2017 to 01/2019 I got 15 months of Payments Late as I lost my job. After I got a new job I rearranged my payment plan again and from  02/2019 the lender keeps reporting me as AP again although these payments are actually higher than originally agreed on when I took out the loan. With the current arrangement the final payment will be made in 01/2021 by which time there will be more APs continuously reported for each month **Questions:** 

1. Do these APs hurt my score? 
2. If so, should I pay off the loan at once and settle? 
3. The last Payment Late entry has been made in 01/2019 so it will take 4 years for Equifax to drop it?  
4. If the loan is going to be settled in 01/2021 and there are more APs until then, will it take 4 years for my score to increase provided there aren't any other derogative marks?"
CRedit,"Hoping y’all can help settle a disagreement. If someone were planning to get a mortgage in July of next year, and has four collections accounts (PFD is not an option) they can settle by the end of the year, would that 

1, restart the reporting timeframe (ie, now it’s sticking around for another 7.5 years) and 

2, be better overall for underwriting?

We are in agreement that paying them after January would be pointless; just sit on the cash and see if the lender will require you to pay them to close. January seems too tight a timeframe to have it be a “new”/updated account. That seems to be the prevailing advice from mortgage brokers in general, and what I’ve been told by a broker friend. Said friend is currently on vacation and unable to weigh in on the wisdom of paying them off 7 or more months prior. 

One of us is of the mindset that having paid/settled each of the accounts 6-7 months prior is fine (ie, by December), while the other thinks it better to just wait because that makes the accounts look too new. 

One of us thinks paying collections in full means they’ll then report for another 7.5 years after that payment, or whether the clock is still determined by the original delinquency date.

FHA or VA loan, if it makes a difference. 

Trying to not give away which of us believes what; a bottle of good tequila is at stake."
CRedit,"Hey guys,

So I’ve been trying to get scores optimized lately, and something weird happened.

I was sitting at an EX score of 695 with balances of $41 (AU account) $69, and $50 showing on 3 of 7 total cards (total credit lines is $36500).  All the other accounts show zero balance.  So overall util was “0%” ($160/36500)

The $50 balance was paid off, and my score dropped to 677.

I’d understand this if ALL the balances dropped to zero, but I can’t figure out this data point.

Hoping the hive mind has some insight."
CRedit,"I have a pretty unique question, and I would appreciate any insight. I remember paying my card off and closing the account years ago, and it has still never shown up on my credit report. However, the past two weeks I was contacted by Synchrony and have received a letter in the mail from a third party debt collector for the same amount, but it still isn't on my credit report! My bank statements do not go back that far, so I don't have proof that I paid it off. I am not 100% sure that I did as again, it was a while ago, but I am almost positive.

Synchrony stated that they didn't sell off my debt, they have just assigned it. So this third party company can not affect my credit, but what is the likelihood of Synchrony selling the debt in the future, and will this just randomly pop-up on my credit one day? They stated that it was charged off in July of 2019, so why isn't on any of the three major credit reports? It is not currently in collections.

And lastly, could paying it off and having them report it to the bureaus as paid then make it show up on my report? I'm just kind of at a loss here, and I'd obviously rather not pay the 800 bucks to settle, but I definitely don't want this on my credit for 7 years.

Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide."
CRedit,"Hello, 

I have a pretty unique question, and I would appreciate any insight. I remember paying my card off and closing the account years ago, and it has still never shown up on my credit report. However, the past two weeks I was contacted by Synchrony and have received a letter in the mail from a third party debt collector for the same amount, but it still isn't on my credit report! My bank statements do not go back that far, so I don't have proof that I paid it off. I am not 100% sure that I did as again, it was a while ago, but I am almost positive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is, if I do nothing, will it ultimately still show up on my report? Synchrony stated that they didn't sell off my debt, they have just assigned it. So this third party company can not affect my credit, but what is the likelihood of Synchrony selling the debt in the future, and will this just randomly pop-up on my credit one day? They stated that it was charged off in July of 2019, so why isn't on any of the three major credit reports?

CRedit,"I have a (paid) collection account on my credit report, and I'm pretty sure it's singlehandedly dragging my Experian score down by 100 points. My Experian report shows that it was paid (&gt;$300) in late June in 2016, and I think it's actually from a missed bill in 2015. I can't remember enough about it to know whether or not I could've disputed it, but I do remember paying off the collections account as soon as I learned of it (I didn't know any better).

I had resigned myself to just waiting for it to drop off of my credit report after the seven-year period (though I read somewhere that it's only five years for New York?), but I recently saw that it dropped off of my Equifax report about two months ago, without any action on my part. I'm thrilled about it, because it instantly brought my Equifax score up by about 100 points, but I have no idea why this happened. Does anyone know how or why this might've happened? Could I use Equifax's removal to help me get it removed from my Experian report?

For a bit more context, I've been trying to get my Experian score over 700 for months, and I'm not sure if there's anything I can do about it while I have this collections sitting on my report. My score is currently at ~670. My general credit factors are fine, as far as I can tell. I have two credit cards with a total current balance of ~1.8K, and a total credit limit of 13K. I haven't missed a payment on either of them. The oldest account I have is almost seven years old. I have no other negative marks on my report. Any help would be incredibly appreciated."

CRedit,"I have one negative thing on my credit (otherwise it's 100% perfect) and that negative thing is supposed to fall off in August after seven years. Does anyone have any idea if it falls off on the first, the 31st or just randomly in-between? It's only on Experian. The other two reports don't have this mark."
CRedit,"So I got a credit card roughly 4 years ago. I was stupid and pretty much just didn't pay it for months (at worst 120/140 days late). My credit was shot, I was in the low 500s. Now thankfully overtime I've worked it back up to 726. Credit karma is now showing that some of the late payments are dropping off even though it definitely hasn't been 7 years. Is this credit karma only reporting for a certain amount of time or do late payments sometime drop off early? Thanks in advance for the input.

Update: its the Vantage 3 scoring system from credit karma for score"
CRedit,"   My Vantage scores ATM are a 718TransUnion and 704Equifax as reported through Credit Karma. 
   My FICO score is 708 as reported through DCU. 
   I currently only have two reports on my credit, one being a student loan of about $3,400 that is just over 17 Months old that Is currently in the process of repayment and a DCU Visa Card that has a $500 limit that I try to utilize an under 30% usage before every statement reporting. 
   I was wondering what were some routes I could take to optimize building a better score and raising my credit further. I was dabbling in the thought of raising my credit limit to double my amount now, but that would require a hard inquire on my record ( which I’m trying to avoid at all costs) but was highly considered seeing I use my credit card quite often instead of dipping into my Savings &amp; Checking accounts. My only hard inquire is on my Equifax side, being from my DCU Visa application last year. 
   DCU has a loan Suite where I could view options as far as loans or credits available to me and I’m approved for a quick loan of $2,000 at 10% APR on a term of 2-12 months, this option only requiring a soft inquire while all others requiring a hard inquire. 
   Would the quick loan be a viable option to boost my score or are there other options I should look into to add another record of credit.?"
CRedit,"I just figured I might as well dispute all of my loans since I thought it couldn't hurt. These were charged off/about to be charged off federal student loans. After disputing I got a notification that 5 new late payments were reported to my credit file. So, was my account brought current? How can I late pay something on a charged off account? I honestly don't get this. Did I F myself over here?"
CRedit,"
Edit : I use credit karma so I suppose this is my vantage score ?
So I recently just paid off about $400 in collections and now my credit score jumped to 669 Trans and 685 Equifax. This is huge for me because my credit score was in the 400’s at the start of this year. (35 derogatory marks on my auto loan)


Now I’m just trying to figure out how to build it more.
My credit consist of about 9000 in a terrible auto loan that I got when I had no credit score, and 3500 student debt which I don’t start paying on for another 2 years or so when I graduate at $50 a month.
I’m only 22 and the longest credit i’ve had is my car for 3 1/2 years which I honestly plan on either paying off or trading in within the next 6 months, whichever would benefit me more but I’m afraid that’ll hurt my score too.

The credit karma simulator is saying  if I open a new credit card that i’ll dramatically drop my credit score and well so I’m not sure how to raise it any further .

Any advice ?"
CRedit,"Filed a dispute on Experian about a derogatory mark that appeared on my report. They deleted the mark from my account in under 10 minutes &amp; closed the dispute in my favor.

Is this just temporary until they review the mark? Thanks!"
CRedit,"It graduated to a $2,000 limit cash rewards card(1.5% cash back).  I was wondering if I should keep it or attempt a product change, and if so what do you recommend? I was thinking the More Rewards but that has a bonus of 30k points if you spend $3000. If so, does Walmart count for the 3x points on supermarkets? If not then I really don't need the More Rewards as I already have the GO rewards card($4k limit). The other cards are the Platinum, visa sig flagship card(3x travel, 2x everything else which seems attractive but don't I need $5k limit+ for visa sig?) Thanks in advance!"
CRedit,"Topic. I have made payments and I want to see my credit. However I can't access any of the bureaus because they are outside the country, I get errors."
CRedit,"This is my first credit card, it's a secured card from capital one. On July 13th I made a purchase of $33.08. My due date isn't until August 16 so I figured I'd wait and pay it today (Friday July 24). This morning I get a notification from credit karma (vantage score) that it dropped 18 points because of the $33.08 balance, I went ahead and paid it right then.

I'm super confused on why this would happen... Am I supposed to always keep a zero balance? Will it go back up when the payment post? I'm extremely frustrated about this and would appreciate any advice."
CRedit,"Two weeks ago, I initiated the process of attempting to contact my original creditor in order to find who owns my charged-off (shown as profit-loss write off) credit card debt (\~$4k). My hope is to pay it outright in order to improve my credit file while rebuilding, as I want to buy a house sometime in the next two years. 

After conversation with them, they admitted owning 1 of the 2 accounts I had open with them, but referred me to a collections agency for the other. After speaking with the collections agency, they stated they sent the account back to the original creditor in December 2019 per the request of the original creditor.

I've called back and forth FOUR TIMES over the span of two weeks, both sides absolutely insisting the other owns the debt. I even disputed ownership through the major credit bureaus, with results showing my original creditor owns the debt. I have asked the escalate to supervisors/management twice on both sides, with the attempts quashed and being told their supervisors says to speak to the other institution.

What are my options here? Disputing was the last card I had in my pocket. Do I just need to be more demanding in escalating to management? Any thoughts?"
CRedit," So, here's the story. On January 18, 2019 my wife and I received our discharge on a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Up until the time of bankruptcy, we had never missed a single payment on anything but suddenly learned that we were facing down \~$200,000 worth of repair costs to a storm water drain system that was effecting the structural integrity of our home that we owed \~$140,000 on and was only valued at about $165,000. We looked at all the options and decided that bankruptcy was our best option, so away we went.

  
Fast forward to now, we are working to rebuild our credit so that we can purchase the house we live in now, which my wife's parents purchased and we are paying the mortgage note on. We have a credit card that somehow survived the bankruptcy that has a $5,000 limit and I have gotten one other card with $1,000 limit. Both have rewards points/cash back, and we run all of our purchases through them and pay the entire balance off several times a month. My wife's vehicle is paid off, and I have an auto loan on my car that I have kept with a mind toward showing good payment habits. The interest rate is pretty high considering the loan was gotten after the bankruptcy, but I paid a significant amount of the value in a down payment and financed a low amount of the vehicle's value with the loan, \~$6,000, just to have a payment to make.

My wife's credit score, according to credit karma, is currently in the very low 700's and mine is sitting just under 700 where it has been shifting up and down a point or two at a time depending on when the two credit card companies report the open balances. I've had a couple of months where my balances were paid off completely at just the right time and my credit utilization was at \~2-3%, and other times that it was at \~15-25%, but we haven't paid a cent in CC interest since our ""fresh start"".

So I say all of that to ask this; I don't know what the right thing is to do next to continue to build my credit score. We need to get our home into our name because we are missing out on the homestead tax exemption and also paying a higher interest rate than most mortgage loans because this is technically a second home for my in-laws. I'm considered a ""thin file"" again because almost all of my previous accounts were closed with the bankruptcy, but I'm worried that applying for more credit will have a worse impact than just waiting. I could pay off my auto loan to save the interest we are paying there, but then I will be moving the number of open accounts backward. I'm also scared to death of applying for anything and being declined, especially a mortgage loan.

So, great people of reddit, what do you think I should do?"
CRedit,"I found out that some of my personal information those places have on file is incorrect.

Also, thanks to my bank giving me a heads up, I have to check with 5 of those places to see if any or all of them have incorrect information. (TransUnion, Equifax, etc.)

Rather than spend all day on the phone pretending like I know what I'm talking about, and straining my already horrible incomprehensible voice, is there a service that will correct this kind of information for you?

(Obviously I'm not in the know when it comes to credit. I've used cash or debit cards my whole life, but now that I'm trying to get a credit card I keep being denied because of no history, and sometimes because they can't verify my identity)"
CRedit,"I have 5 collections,  but under type, all they show is --.  I believe the type is actually entered under remarks because there it shows medical or collections account. Would this be a basis for disputing?  Another shows affected by natural disaster. I have no idea what that even is supposed to mean.
I currently have no open accounts like credit cards and auto. In fact I paid my truck off a few months ago. Anyhow, how do I get a credit card with bad credit?"
CRedit,"Let’s start here, I am 19 with a credit score just over 700. (Fico: 732) I have two cards; a Discover Secured ($200), as well as an Apple Card ($250). I’ve had both for less than a year, September. 

I use less than 20% of both of my card combined per month, and pay them off early and in full. I’ve never missed a payment. I know that the most effective way to build credit is to use less than 30% of your monthly allowance. 

Every month when my statement is released, my score drops about 4 points. I don’t really understand why. 

I’m very proud of myself, even though my limits are low. My mother has gone through two bankruptcy, one is current. 

Please give me answers because i’m really starting to get annoyed."
CRedit,"I'm hoping I can get some tips on rebuilding my credit and really maximizing a higher score over the next six months. 

My score has drastically improved from low 300s a few years ago and is now sitting at low 600's. I removed a lot of accounts and really cleaned up my report. 

FICO 8; Experian - 604, Equifax - 620, TransUnion - 618

Most recently in the past month, I had a final collection removed from these accounts which boosted each of them to the above scores \~40 points. 

My first step was getting a secured credit card. I have the Open Sky card with a $500 limit. It first reported on my credit report a few days ago and dropped each score 3-4 points, as expected. Any suggestions on maximizing this account to grow my score quicker?

Other accounts on my report include 4 closed US Department of Education Loans.

Three of them have balances - $6,000; $5,500; and $3,300 and 47 charge offs (Im looking to start paying these again as I have the means, especially if it can help my credit score). One of them is closed with $0 balance and 13 late payments. 

I'm thinking of opening a Self Credit Builder Loan to help increase my score quicker. Does anyone have experience with this? Do you think it will help based on the above or hurt my score? Does anyone have experience if paying a larger monthly fee helps your score more or not? 

I'm hoping to raise my score by \~70 points over the next six months so I can have my score in ""Good"" status and be approved to rent an apartment on my own - no guarantor. 

Also, my bank is opening a secured card - Chime. I am close to being off the waitlist. Would another secured card hurt my credit? Is there any benefit? 

Any tips, suggestions, experience with the above, etc would be greatly appreciated."
CRedit,"Hi all! My credit has never been great but last year after several deaths, I entered quite a state and things got out of hand. I’ve been working my tail off to correct them (paid off all but one of my collections which is set to autopay- three more times and will be paid off as wel!). My score has gotten up to 550/570 depending on which report you look at. I know it’s not good but I’m proud of how much I’ve gotten it up in a short amount of time. I’m desperately trying to claw my way up to 640 to qualify to be added to a home loan we’d like to apply for sometime this winter if possible. Currently I have no credit cards. I have an auto loan that I’m currently ahead by two months on for payments. I have a full time stable job as does my husband (his score is much better than mine).I have a small bit of savings as well. I’m looking for options to help. I’ve been reading others posts on here but was hopeful that someone could offer me some specific to my issues advice. Thank you so much!"
CRedit,"I have a weird situation I find myself in. I was going to get pre-approved for a mortgage in August, as my wife and I both have the required savings and the 760+ credit scores to get the best interest rate. The issue is that my car loan company sold to another company, and even though I’ve never been late on a payment, they closed the account and now opened an account under the new company name. What a wammy! My score is now down to 730 despite me doing everything right for years to get to this point. Does anyone have any advice? I was literally 2 weeks away from going to get pre-approved. To say that I’m aggravated is an understatement.

Edit: I was keeping the car payment for now to avoid closing the account before getting the mortgage. I’m wondering if it’s just better to pay it off now, but now afraid of having 2 closed accounts after all that for the same car."
CRedit,"I want to pay my debt, but I have heard horror stories about PRA and that if you accept their settlement offer that they can then sue you and just ignore the offer. They sent me an offer for me to pay off an old debt with a discount and in exchange, they will take the debt off my credit report and forgive the rest, can I trust them? Hiring an attorney would be more expensive then just paying off the debt. They do say in the letter that they will not sue me and they do not intend to sue me even if I don't accept the offer."
CRedit,"Im a College student (20 yo) who is delivering pizza full time. I make an income of around 1700 usd a month (mostly in tips). My credit score is 655 (used credit karma)  and I have a credit card,student loans, and I’m renting an apartment so I guess that is the reason for score. 

    I recently was the victim in a hit and run that has caused me to have upwards of 3000 dollars worth of damage on my old Toyota Camry that is currently undriveable. The police aren’t convinced that they will be able to find the driver off the traffic camera and also my insurance said that they wouldn’t do anything.  Because of this l have decided to go ahead and apply for a car loan so I can replace my car which was already on a downward slope before the accident. 

The asking price of the car I’m interested in is $4400 but I probably won’t be paying that price because my dad will be helping me negotiate. He is also putting the down payment down and will likely be co-signing the loan. I am receiving help from him as a recent move to my apartment took up most of my savings. My dad has great credit and is pretty financially well off. 

What I’m asking is do you think it’s possible for me to get this car loan? Or any advice"
CRedit,"Hi guys, I'm an 18 year old and know a lot about credit cards. Although secured cc is the easiest to get I know that I need to prove my income or assets. If I have around $2000 in my checking acct, will I be accepted to (for example) the Discover IT secured card? Let me know guys :)"
CRedit,"Long story short, I have a lot of medical debt that has gone to collections over the years because I thought it would go away if I didn’t pay it long enough. Obviously wrong, but I’m scared it’s going to end up on my credit report in the near future if I don’t find it and take care of it. My credit score is 753 and I want to buy a house soon-ish and I’m hoping to settle the debts before they end up on my reports and crush everything. How can I track all my medical debt down? And is it possible to have payment plans on debts in collections or will I be required to pay an amount in full on the spot?

Thanks for any suggestions!"
CRedit,"Hello everyone,

     Question, with the pandemic that’s going on were the credit reporting bureaus allowed to take longer than the 30-45 days allowed by law to investigate a dispute? I sent a dispute to each bureau middle of April with a follow up after the 45 days and haven’t heard anything back from either one? No updates or validation letters nothing. Is anyone else having the same issue?"

CRedit,"Good afternoon, 

After making several mistakes early on with student loans, I finally have my private loans taken care of, I am still paying on my federal, but its unimportant right now. 

I currently have about $375 in collections over 2 different accounts. These are accurate amounts and I owe the debt. The accounts are from when I was briefly homeless and couldn't pay off old utility bills at the time. After looking at this subreddit, it mentions a PFD as a useful tool. While I understand the process it just seems to be a headache for such a low amount. 

I am able to safely pay 100% of the debt today, and the accounts are not scheduled to roll off until late 2023. I just got a secured card and want to start upping my score from a 550. I had other collections roll off late last year, and have had no active accounts for awhile.

My questions are: is it better to pay off the debt or do the PFD? If I pay off the debt is the company required to report it as paid off?"
CRedit,"Hey, kind folks! 2020 has been a huge dumpster fire of a year but the one good thing for me has been paying off almost all of my credit card debt! I started the year off owing about $15k and after a small promotion (46 to 51k), making some extra money from my hobby (and not putting any back into it, which is what got me into this mess in the first place), and just setting my mind to paying it off as soon as possible, I am now down to just 4k owed. That balance has now been transferred to a 0% interest card. 

I am hopeful that I can pay this last chunk off by November or December at the latest. I am no longer using my credit cards for ANYTHING that I can't pay off right away. Having carried this burden of ever-increasing debt since I was 24, it is so freeing and motivating to have an end in sight. I can't wait for the day I can receive my paycheck and not have any of it go to credit cards!"
CRedit,"Good morning Members,

first time posting have a question with some backstory. I have a tradeline account that was closed on my credit report from over 2 years ago that was charged off for a whole 24 dollars. I was unaware of this until me and my wife were renting an apartment and were informed the charge off went into collections. I went through all my paperwork and old statements and found the one where the creditor closed the account for inactivity and my balance was 0. I drafted up 3 dispute letters and made a copy of the closed account statement and mailed them to all three credit bureaus along with a copy of my driver's license and a utility bill. That was the middle of April of this year and have not heard back anything from either not even a letter saying investigation complete or nothing. My question is with the Pandemic going on were the credit bureaus allowed to take longer than the 30-45 days allowed by law? or are they just jerking me around?"
CRedit,"My mother added me to one of her store credit cards a few years ago. As far as I know, she makes every payment on time. However, she has a really high balance as she is awful with money. I believe around $1200. She is also filing for bankruptcy soon (not sure if that hurts it?). She isn't reporting this card that I'm aware of and still makes the payments.

It is my ""oldest"" card, if I were to take it off I believe my second oldest is only about 3 years.

I actually tried to get it removed one time. I had my mom call and the person on the phone told my mom that it doesn't hurt my credit and kept trying to talk her out of it. She told him to remove me and he said OK. A year later and I'm still on there so I have no idea what happened there.

I just want to know if it will hurt me more than help me to remove it. I will be applying for an apartment within the next few months and don't want my credit score to take a huge hit. TIA"
CRedit,Title explains it but my capital one creditwise report lists “age of oldest account” and the age given is 2 years older than I am. Is this a fluke? Will it be a red flag once I go to buy a house?
CRedit,"Hi'

What would be the best options for a 1st credit card (UK)? 

I'm looking to get couple things out of it:

1.Card should be free.

2.Build my credit score (it is ""fair"" atm; ClearScore, Experian, CreditKarma, it's Vantage Credit Score).

3.Card should be accepted widely, if I get cashback/rewards even better (I mostly shop at: M&amp;S, John Lewis, Waitrose, Planet Organic, Currys, etc).

Thank you!"
CRedit,"Hello, so I’ve recently started working on my credit after 19 year old me decided to be lazy and idiotic and incur a lot of it! Im currently 23 and my credit sits around mid 500s (improved after actually paying my bills) and I was just approved for a $300 credit card through my credit union for paying my car loan consistently. I still have debt from an old kohl’s card ($534 after collections, originally $80) I took out, nearly 5 years ago, and an old school loan directly from my old university when I tried to go back to school a couple years ago ($8,900 after collections, originally $2,800). I want to attempt and settle a deal with my current debt collectors but I have the irrational fear of being taken advantage of because I tend to be a pushover and just overly nice. Does anyone have any tips or tricks when it comes to dealing with this? And do you think it would still be possible to apply for a house loan with my girlfriend (her score is high 700s) after a year of settling those debts?"
CRedit,I paid 3 $200 payments on my credit card to get the balance down to under 50% after reading some posts on here. Checked my credit score after a month to give it time to update &amp; it hasn’t budged. Is this not the way to raise my score? I only have a couple more $200 payments before it’s just paid off &amp; I’d like to see some benefit from paying off the balance. Any advice?
CRedit,"My scores are suffering because I have concentrated my CC debt on my lowest APR cards...for the obvious reason that despite these 3-4 cards being maxed out, they offer the lowest overall cost. Apparently the not-so-wise scoring models would prefer me to spend MORE money by spreading the balances out over the remaining cards...thereby incurring much more interest...which puts me in a MORE NEGATIVE financial position...*just so* the balance to limit ratio is under 30%. 

Is it not silly to pay more money when you can pay less? Why isn't the interest rate shown on the credit report? If this information was visible, a lender could see why some cards are maxed out and others have a zero balance. It's frustrating to be penalized for doing the smart thing!!"
CRedit,"For starters, I have solid credit report; 5+ years of history, everything paid in full, no late payments. I pulled my report a few weeks ago and everything was in line. My FICO 3 was calculated as 777 based on Experian data. 

Earlier today, I tried to open a Sprint account. Sprint did a hard pull on my credit then rejected me with no explanation. I'm suspicious it might be because of my address. I've moved several times within the last year. I've read that if the address on the application doesn't match with what the credit bureau has they'll outright deny it. Is there any way to figure out what address they have to prevent another failed hard pull?"
CRedit,"Hey all! Looking for some advice on my situation. 

Last year I bought a phone on credit with one of those no interest for 1 year deals. I stupidly thought that there wouldn't be minimum payments and went 60 days delinquent. It's all paid off now, but I'm hoping to have those remarks removed. 

My argument is that the credit card company send the credit card to the incorrect address... '1234 my street' instead of '1235 my street'. This actually happened and I never received a bill from the lender. I called the company up and the operator said it was their mistake and that she would remove the late remarks, but the creditor never did. 

After calling today, a new operator said they did an investigation and no error was found. 

Do I have a case with this? Any advise would be very much appreciated!!"
CRedit,"Hi guys, 

Quick question, my first credit card when I came here 8 months ago was a Bank of America secured card which I opened with my bank account. I had no idea what the banker wanted me to do but all he asked for was $300 as a security and so I paid it and got a credit card. 

Eight months later realizing what credit is here in the states i wanted to ask if I use that $300 credit card, pay it multiple times in 30 days while using it does that negatively or positively affect my credit

Thanks"
CRedit,"Guys, I finally did it! Saved enough money to pay of 3 credit cards all with significantly high credit usage. At one point all 3 cards were maxed out!

Decided earlier this year that I wanted to buy a house but in order to do that I had to be credit card debt free. So I basically put my big girl panties on and saved, saved, saved. Saved several hundred dollars here and there and paid huge chuck a on each card every single time. Today I finally made my final payments and I’m officially CREDIT CARD DEBT FREE! Well okay okay maybe I’m exaggerating because I do have one card that I plan on using for gas (Apple Card) but I never use more than 50 bucks on it and pay of off completely each month. Anyway wish me luck! Hopefully this helps boost my score so I can start the process in November!"
CRedit,"I have a $7k joint credit line through synchrony for my sleep number bed with a $3720 balance remaining out of about $4k. I have several years left to pay. 41 months.

But it's a joint account and I'm separating my finances (divorce). They will not let me transfer the balance to another account from within it, or remove my spouse from the account. It's joint and needs his SSN and I really don't want this account for the next 41 months. They will not budge or give me any options. All I can do is pay it off and close the account.

By paying it off I either need the $3720 in cash (ha!) or I imagine I can start a loan or I can use a balance transfer on an existing credit card.

I pay $90/month to synchrony and there's no interest for the life of the purchase. I can't afford much more. This was really a great deal and I don't want to have to refinance it.

My Discover card gives me 0% for the first year and I could open a new card with 0% for 18 months but I don't know what I'd be paying in total interest for the life of my payments.

I just got approved for a loan at 12% and it'll cost over $1100 in interest.

Can anyone help me find the best option?"
CRedit,"I have searched reddit and google on this but can't find the answer. I have a loan with a string of late payments years ago (thought the loan was being deferred along w/ other student loans. It wasn't). The first delinquent mark on my credit report is a 120 day late payment. Is the date of first delinquency 90 days before this mark (i.e. when the account was first 30d late) or is it when the 1st late payment (the 120-day one) showed up on the report? My credit report doesn't say what the DOFD is, unfortunately. Trying to figure out when it will drop off..."
CRedit,"Hi. I had a great credit history before losing my job which resulted in all four of my accounts got charged off last year. I made settlements for all four accounts, just finished my agreement for the credit one account (which I focused on because the agency actually deletes once you settle the account), made half a payment on my credit union credit card account balance of $379, made a payment arrangement for $530 discover for 5 payments over 5 months, and made a starter payment of $48 for my capital one card for which I have an upcoming agreement (which my question focuses on). 

I also got my secured open sky card with a $500 credit limit to start rebuilding. 

Now my question is regarding how quickly should I work to pay these accounts off. I am on unemployment due to covid  and as you know the extra federal payment is limbo. I made an arrangement to have pay $400 on the capital one card next week, which would actually settle the account (which would be my last enhanced UI payment as it stands now). 

But now I am wondering if I should make a smaller payment to keep more money in my pocket with all this uncertainty. Just how much does paying off collections/charge offs help your score? Does it make so significant a difference that rushing to pay off the account is worth it, or should I make a more manageable payment plan and focus on using the secured credit to rebuild my credit."
CRedit,"Hey there! First post on this thread. I just graduated and I have enough money to pay my student loans balance in full (about $3000), but have heard before that its better to drag it out over a while, say, $30 a month. Even though I'll pay more in interest, it's supposedly better for my credit score to keep those accounts open? Something about having a variety of things impacting my credit. I have a credit card that I only use for gas and pay off in full before the due date, but thats pretty much the only other thing affecting my credit. Do any of you know anything about this? Any advice is appreciated!"
CRedit,"Here we go. So yesterday I paid off my last bit of debt. Two accounts in collections. My sister has stellar credit and made me an authorized user on one of her credit cards. I have no loans, no credit cards of my own and now no debt. What is my next step. I'm completely clueless. Do I wait for my score to go up? Apply for a credit card? I want to ultimately apply for a loan for a car and get a credit card in my name. I made some very poor choices a few years back now I'm trying to get back on track. My scores are in the mid 500's."
CRedit,"Okay so I disputed a collection charge through credit karma and it was removed at the beginning of this year, then I disputed it with Experian recently, it was denied, and then they put it back on my Equifax report????? It's not mine!!! And I got it taken off?? How is that possible???? Is that legal??? It's not even mine!!!"
CRedit,"I have a few private student loans through Key Bank that I took out back in 2004/2005 that started demanding repayment several years ago. (I did try to work with them but whenever I asked to speak to someone about trying to make the payments something I could actually afford, they'd redirect me to another branch/person, then that one would do the same, driving me in circles.) I ended up not making payments at all. Officially they closed the accounts back in 2018. However, I just found that they reported it NOW as charge-offs to my credit on June 30, 2020. I guess I just don't understand how it can be possible to add it to my credit two years after closing it instead of the 120 or 180 days as everything online reports. And I am just curious if there is any option to fight it being added this long after the fact. I get that these are consequences of not paying money I didn't have (I do pay all my other student loans as they were willing to work with me to make it financially feasible to pay.), but I'm mostly just astounded that they're just now doing this instead of doing so at the time.  


I'm in Texas and all together, they are reporting 10 negative charge-offs with 5 of them in the balance amount of $0 being reported."
CRedit,"My Brother in law got a notice today from Experian that a hard inquiry had been made on his account&gt;

He has not applied for any type of loan from them.    
We immediately put a freeze on all three credit agencies.(perhaps to late).

The hard inquiry does not appear on equifax or trans-union at this point.    

Tried to call the SBA number and followed the prompts according to his situation, was one hold as number 229 in line for 20 minutes, then the line connected and rang and promptly disconnected.     

Going to call back but wonder what else we should start, afraid there may be someone fraudulently attempting to take out a loan in his name.
Thanks"
CRedit,"I've went about trying to find information myself but I just keep getting confused. 

I had a missed payment of $14.05 from a homedepot credit card that I was not aware that had been charged. 30 days went by and they reported it, I found out about this while applying for loans and found out my almost perfect score dropped into the lower 600's. Ive contacted the lender and paid off the card thinking this was the right thing to do. The lender is saying they can't do anything now that its been reported, and I just feel sick to my stomach that I'm taking such a large hit over $14. It was definetly my fault, an oversight, but my fault. Is there anything I can do? I have multiple loans and credit cards that I pay off, I've never missed a payment. I just keep getting told to dispute but I know it was my fault and not sure what a dispute will do."
CRedit,"Hello guys. I am approaching the two year post chapter 7 bankruptcy mark next month. I have been very successful in getting my credit back on track. I started out with three secured credit cards right out of bankruptcy. One secured card, my Discover IT card rolled my secured line to unsecured, refunded me the $600 deposit and increased my credit line to $1500. And that was around a year ago. Since then I have been declined time and time again for an increase.  

Here’s positive changes on my file to note:

Obtained a fourth credit card through CreditOne, an Amex card with a limit of $2200, and, an auto loan for 2.90 percent financing around six months ago. 

I mainly use my Discover IT card for the 1.5percent cash back they offer. Because I put all of my monthly expenditures on this card, I really want to keep it and increase the line, but, I have been getting declined each and every time. 

I’m kinda at that point of maybe trying again for a credit line increase, last attempt was six months ago. If I get declined, perhaps I should ditch this card and apply for another card with rewards similar to Discover. 

My FICO is 660 through Discovers credit scoring model, which is the same score my credit union used for my auto loan. My FACO (CreditKarma) is around 710 ish. 

Should I just hold off on trying to get a CLI or go for it and apply elsewhere if I get declined?"
CRedit,"So in college I screwed up and didn't make a payment on a citi card I had for 3 months. Obviously it was a dumb thing to do and I've been rebuilding my credit since then. They shut down the card and I set up autopay to pay off the minimum. After college when I got a job I ended up paying off the amount left in full. When I check my credit it still says that I have serious delinquency on my account, and that it will reflect for up to 7 years. I have another credit card now that I use for just gas and have never missed another payment on my bills/loans/other card. I know its dragging down my credit score still, but am just curious as to how long and how severely this will effect it, or what else I can do to help offset it on my credit score. Thanks!

Edit: I'm checking it on FICO thru my discover account and on nerdwallet. Theres about a 10 point difference between them which I assume is from it using different reports"
CRedit,"After spending the last 7 months **aggressively paying down debt**, I have considered how I spend my money (dining and movies and groceries) and how my current credit cards don't reward me all that much (1-2% cash back or airline miles).

I don't want a hard inquiry on my file unless I get approved: based on the below, how likely is it that I would be approved?

CRedit,There is one medical collection on my report that was originally reported in 10/2016. The state statute of limitations is 6 years but two credit reports state it will fall off either in Sept 20 or Nov 20.  I'm not sure if I should reach out to the collection agency to arrange payment because 2020 will not be 6 years or if I should wait and see what happens.
CRedit,"I applied for financing through a dealership. I have good credit (749), long employment history - no red flags. There were three hard inquiries on my report from three different places (the dealership, a bank, and one that is like ""capital auto finance""). Is this normal?"
CRedit,"I had paid off a $600 debt to Progressive insurance through a settlement agreement after it went to collections. It shows on my credit report as  ""**Settled - less than full balance"".** Does this have a negative impact on my overall score? If so, what would be the recommendation?"
CRedit,"Hi all,

I just noticed that one of my “closed” accounts, while not showing up as a collections or “derogatory remark” on my CK app, is still being reported as recently as this month.

Details: 
First Premier Bank - $544 of a $400 balance 
-Opened June 2014, Closed July 2015, “charged off as bad debt profit and write off”

Doesn’t look like it was transferred anywhere. What should my next step be? Call first premier and see if I can pay it still? Apparently this is still hurting my credit if it’s still being reported, right?"
CRedit,"Hi all,

On one of my reports the average age of credit is lower than I would like, because it's missing a 15-year old account. The account was removed years ago after I challenged a late payment--now that I've cleaned it up, if I ask the creditor to report to the third bureau, am I risking them resubmitting the late payment from years back?

Thanks!"
CRedit,"What is a recordable company that will manage a customer’s credit report for them. 

I will pay ANYTHING for a company / person that will spend the hours necessary for all these phone calls, begging, scanning, filing, checking back weeks later. 

What is a company that follows through on their promises and do this?  I am being 100% serious. 

If there is no company that does this, why is that? Is it illegal or something? There have to be millions of people that need someone to manage their credit report for them.... 

I’ve seen the posts here that say “it can be done yourself”.  I know that. I don’t want to do it. I want to pay someone else to do it. I won’t want these companies to have my home address. I don’t want them having my phone number. I do not have to time to be on the phone for hours. I don’t want all this paper all over the place. I want to pay someone that is credible to do this.  I don’t care what the price is. Who actually does this and is not a scam?"
CRedit,"Hi all,

I have been trying to read up on this and I’m getting mixed reviews. 

My CK score is currently 518. Horrible. I have a few things in collections, most between 1-2 years (hard times). 

If I pay off collections account (let’s say at a lower cost), will that actually improve my score? Google says no, credit karma says by 20-25 points. 

Also do collectors really do PIF for removal? How does one go about that?

My goal is to get to 600 by December if possible. I currently have a car loan (late payments, but caught up now) and 1 Citi secured card (500 limit) with all on time payments, with a 50% util. Gonna be getting that down into the 30 range this month though. Does this goal seem reasonable if I pay off these collections? (About 5)

Thanks!"
CRedit,"I see lots of posts about how people get surprised or frustrated that their scores are so different across vendors and models.  I thought I would share mine.  I'm in the midst of a credit rebuild (I was in the 550s in December), but you can kinda see how wildly these scores can vary.

*All Vantage scores via SmartCredit, all FICO scores via MyFICO*

**Experian**

* Vantage - 654
* FICO8 - 692
* FICO2 - 681 (Mortgage)
* FICO Auto 8 - 654
* FICO Bankcard 8 - 707

**Equifax**

* Vantage - 677
* FICO8 - 666
* FICO5 - 644 (Mortgage)
* FICO Auto 8 - 654
* FICO Bankcard 8 - 659

**TransUnion**

* Vantage - 656
* FICO8 - 646
* FICO4 - 617 (Mortgage)
* FICO Auto 8 - 603
* FICO Bankcard 8 - 665

**Observations**

* Highest vantage is with Equifax, but my highest everything else is with Experian.  
* 64 point gap in the mortgage scores between Experian and TransUnion
* If I was applying for a car loan and looking at a Vantage score from Equifax (677), it would be pretty shocking to learn my TransUnion auto score is 603 (74 points lower).  
* There's 104 point gap between the highest and lowest scores on the chart.

Anyway, your mileage may vary, but there's generally lots of room for variance across two major vendors (FICO and Vantage) and a wide array of different scoring models.  They each value things differently.  

I'm a big fan of MyFICO, and recommend it to anyone interested in managing their credit."
CRedit,"I have a couple of old (4-5 years) late payments on cards with Citi and Capital One listed on my credit report. Fact is that these were not actually late payments and I know this because my credit report itself says ""Never late"" for these accounts... Even though these alleged late payments are relatively old and will fall off in 2-3 years, they are materially hurting my credit score and keeping me below 700 unnecessarily...

I tried calling both Citi and Capital One to explain the issue and ask for them to correct it. Citi said they would look into it but then sent me a form letter saying they investigated and found no error in their reporting of the account to the CRA. Capital One told me that they have no access to payment history more than 2 years old and couldn't do anything for me... Next I tried writing  to both Citi and Capital One and this time, tried asking for a goodwill/courtesy removal of these alleged late payments (though contesting that they were in fact truly late payments). Both wrote back and said no.

I need to get these off my credit report! What can I do now to get these removed? Is suing them for inaccurately reporting the only way to get them to correct? Is there a higher level of customer service that can address this? Do I have to be one of those people that sends a letter to the CEO requesting they correct their error?

Any advice / suggestions are appreciated!!!"
CRedit,"Hey guys i am 22 year old college student that had to leave home at 17 so in turn i have made some dumb credit decisions along the way. 

My score as of right now is a 598 (Credit Karma Transunion &amp; Equidax) vantage score

Accounts into: 

Closed Wells Fargo Card. /// closed due to being inactive and behind on payments due to financial hardship &amp; college expenses. I hit the 120 max inactivity days so they closed the card with a balance of $1060 sitting. 

The only other accounts that show on my credit are student loans which are in good standing and currently deferred as i am still in school. 

With that being said i feel super embarrassed about my credit and i hate that i let it get to this point of having a closed card on my score. I don’t know how to proceed. Should i pay off the entire balance or settle for the amount that most banks offer? And regardless of what option i choose for that what steps should i look toward taking for upping my score. 

I don’t come from a financial literate background  but i am trying to educate myself and mend my mistakes sooner rather than later so i apologize if i sound a bit dramatic.

JAN 2020


Paid off all debts ($1600 Wells Fargo)


Opened BestBuy card ($1000) and spent $950, all on time payments, paid off in full July 2020




MARCH 2019


Opened Discover Card $750 limit 



Have paid all cards on time in full since May 2019, score moved 514&gt;650.




Experian credit simulator says potential 670 after 24 months of further on time payments and reflects negatively on opening any further lines/loans etc.
Is there any way to get to 700 without waiting 3-4 years? 




I have 3 closed accounts, quite a few late payment marks, one closed account will disappear in 2022, the other 2 probably 2026-2027.



I'm also looking at getting a mortgage in 2021 my FICO 2 is 652....is that entirely  horrible in a lenders eyes?"
CRedit,"So, going through credit report and notice an outstanding debt from 2019 that I was pretty positive that I had paid in full.  I called the collections group that was listed on my credit report and said that file was with the a law firm.  Called the law firm (got sued on this one) told the account was still opened and owed $259 (counting interest).  I asked how that was possible, I was on a payment plan 2018/2019 and then called to pay off early in 2019.  Apparently, when the collector took the final payment, it was rejected by the firm they were hired by or his back office as it would have been an overage.  I never received a call or letter saying this and had not idea I still owed the money.  When I called I ended up getting the same collector that I had set everything up with in 2019.  According to the collector he wasn't notified either.  He then said to clear it up, I had to pay the amount.

My argument is that i made the payment in good faith, they agreed and then declined to accept the payment after they agreed to.  The account should closed as payment in full, my credit rating should be corrected or trade line removed.    The guy started to push back and said they wouldn't do it and how was I going to pay.  He changed his tune, when I said I feel this is a violation of FCRA (might fall under UDAAP) and I am going to file a complaint with the state.  He then typed up notes and said he would get back to me and see what they could do.

**Do I really have any recourse on this?**  Really it's not a money issue at this point, just pisses me off that I tried to pay it off and they cancelled the payment and didn't tell me about it and let it sit a accumulate interest.  I have not received any notifications from them prior to me calling... Also, before anyone asks - No I did not notice the payment had come out or follow up on why I didn't get a letter.  (live and learn).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*Update\*\*\*\*

Well, the rep (at the law firm) I talked to submitted a request to have the remainder of the money waived and the account closed as a ""settled for less"".  I called back and talked to a supervisor and told her that I never agreed to a settlement, I want this considered paid in full and back dated to 2019, when we agreed to pay it.  The supervisor looked at it and it sounded like, the amount I actually paid and the amount they were trying to collect wasn't the same.  They reviewed it, called me back and have closed the collection amount as paid in full.  I talked to the creditor that had hired the law firm and they show the account as paid in full as of 2019 and have deleted the collection trade line from my credit report.  I have also received satisfaction of judgement from the courts in the mail.  "
CRedit,"Hello All, 

I have been following this thread for sometime and am eager to embark and start rebuilding my Credit. I am 27 Y/O and about 3 years ago started trying to rebuild my credit through Lexington Law, Self Lender and Secured Credit Cards. I was able to build myself up to a 690 and was making roughly $40,000 a year. Once again I regressed and have now fallen to a 560 with significant charge-off, etc. 

In the last year I was fortunate to gain traction in my professional pursuits and was making about $85,000 a year but due to the pandemic have been placed on furlough likely until 2021. I want to use this time to focus on rebuilding my Credit if at all possible. I have learned through the subreddit that Lexington Law and the like will never be as effective as one setting out to fix it for themselves. As such, I want to start but feel like its a massive knot that has no beginning.  

I have recently downloaded my 3 credit reports using the Annual Credit report portal and am happy to share it with anyone who can help give me a little direction.

Student Loans $7000.00  - These are in default status but I am working on a payment plan to get them out of default 

Portfolio Recovery - This was an old capital one card. I paid them off in agreement for a deletion. Got it in writing. They said within 30 days this should come off

IC Systems: This is an old water bill where I fought the water company of our city because they tried to charge everyone HUGE increases one year when we had a freeze. I disputed my bill and they got back to me six months later with a letter saying I owed them zero.  BUT that was a typo apparently and I owe them $300.00. I def want to fight this one. 

Credit Builder card 3 months old in good standing with no balance

1 self lender account in good standing opened 6 months ago 

Chase Card my mom put me as an auth user on- has excellent history and low balance

I also apparently have a default Judgment from 2005 in NJ that was against me for a credit card and a loan I never took out from Asset Acceptance.  I dont even know if they are still around. This is no longer on my credit report but could come up on a title search.   They combined these two accounts so I refused to pay for the loan portion because I never took that out. I was in my 20s and stupid.

 Any advice as to where to get started would be appreciated."
CRedit,I got a call from a collections attorney stating that I owe my university 2k. I have never heard of this debt and it isn’t reported on my credit report. Are they able to report this as a collections now even though the debt is old? I didn’t even know I owed my university money. I am really unsure how to proceed and protect my credit
CRedit,Basically what title said. I'm concerned of my Fico Score since I closed the account due to the Annual Fee on it but now think it's a bad idea that I did since my overall available credit would go down by $600.
CRedit,"Hi all! I’m trying to help my sister with her credit. She currently has a 490 with 4 collections, some of which she doesn’t recognize so I have started disputing those. That takes awhile. 

In the meantime, does anyone know the best secured credit card for her to start out with?"
CRedit,"And have a score of 557, With nothing against my credit. I’m 23 and just have never had any loans or credit cards and I would like to start building my credit.

I’d like to start with a credit card or two but I’m not sure about secured cards or any other options? Any help is appreciated."

CreditCards,I called Discover today in regards to a CLI after having the acct for 7 months and the told me they are not handing any out until 12 months of activity now due to COVID. Thought this would be good information to share with you all.
CreditCards,"I know there's already a post about SSN remark blocker placed on 7/31 at Chase have been removed, still I feel like sharing my emotional journey this month and my DP.

* Current cards:  
*Discover It $2.5K, April 2019*  
*BofA Cash Rewards $1.5K, March 2020*  
*BofA Premium Rewards $1.5K, March 2020*

* FICO Score: *745-ish*
* Oldest account age:  *1 year 3 months*
* Chase 5/24 status:  *3/24 before CFU*
* Income:  *$75K*

So I applied CFU on 7/31, and no replies, called the auto line and heard 7-10 days, called recon and asked to send SSN (saying work only DHS bla bla bla). 

Sent SSN and the auto line now says 2 weeks, I thought: nice! 

And in another couple days, the auto line turned back to 7-10 days and I panicked called recon once again. Now they're saying the nonsense about SSN is invalid. Took a whole afternoon and I just gave up talking to them and let it be. (mid August)

On 8/28 they sent me the card without emailing me or adding the card to my Chase app (I opened banking accounts with them at the end of June)

It turns out that they reverted the decision and auto-reconned me! One hassle is that they created another Chase profile for CFU, so I cannot find the CFU on my banking profile at all. I had to call in, and the 2nd rep (Indian accent woman) combined 2 profiles. The craziest thing is the first rep (white male voice) picked up my phone INSISTED there's nothing he can do and I have to constantly sign in and out with 2 pairs of profile name and password, and I really raised my voice and called out his BS, he does not comply and said it's impossible to combine them...

As an expat in the US, I really appreciate the 2nd rep for looking out for fellow minorities! Even though we had a hard time understanding each other's accents!

Now I am so happy with CFU with 5x grocery, 5x lyft, 3x dining, 3x drugstore. For someone who does not drive and live in a city, I have no needs for wholesales or gas. So this card made my BofA Premium almost obsolete other than using public transit for 2% cashback, when covid made me comfortable enough to hop on again, and being in Chicago, the L lines gave me so much cringe, so many people do not wear a mask! Even the number is soaring in IL and Cook County, it is insane.

Now the question is which card should I get first to do the trifecta? Potentially upgraded CSP or CFF to be my 5th/24?

Edit: confused 7-10 days and 2 weeks originally"
CreditCards,"What's the point of Interest Rate &amp; APR if you pay in full or in time every month?

And what's the math involved in all of this? How is it that these numbers help you save money in the long term?"
CreditCards,"I signed up for a store credit card in 2018, solely for the perks/points.  I quickly became a top-level customer, never returned any purchases, never tried to bend any rules or purchase for anyone else on my account.

In the first week of April, right when quarantine had begun, my account was hacked on the store’s company website, and my earned points were stolen to place a store pick-up order (the thief, in another state, changed my name to hers to match her photo ID at local store pickup).

As soon as I saw my emails about suspicious account activity, I called the company to report the fraud.  I waited on hold for almost an hour to finally be connected to someone who told me that the company cannot, in any circumstance, cancel orders placed online.  She told me that if the order was not picked up after 5 days, it would auto-cancel.  

The hacker picked up her order.

I am now permanently banned from shopping at this store for violating their terms of the program:  no purchases may be made for anyone besides yourself, and the woman who hacked my account was not me, so I am banned.

I was told the only way to secure my account and close it down, so the hacker could not continue to compromise my account now that she had my telephone # for store checkout, was to wait for stores to re-open after quarantine.

I tried contacting Cs through email multiple times, Facebook, Instagram, and by phone many times.  Everyone in CS is outsourced to a third part, and none of the representatives know anything.

Finally, when my local store opened two months later, I found a ride to the store (I am severely disabled and not able to shop in person almost always) to close my account.  Waited in line for almost 2 hours and, long story short, after spending a deal of time on the phone with CS behind the counter (because no one had any idea what to do), I was assured again by CS that if I left my account open, they would launch an “internal investigation” into how this all went so poorly, and would contact me back directly within 2 weeks at the most.  This was on 6/30.

The company clearly will not let me close my account, and I don’t know how many times I can get rides to my local store (very inconveniently located to me), just in order to close my account.  No one in store knows how to do such a thing.  I continue to be sent coupons for free products and offers for bonuses points that I’m not allowed to take advantage of.

Now I have a credit card with Comenity Bank and no way to use it.  My limit is around $1,000.  Closing the account would hurt my credit; but, again, I am prohibited from using it.

Am I screwed?  TIA."
CreditCards,"So I have an Amazon Prime card. I was looking to purchase some computer parts, and when I added everything into my cart, it was giving me two different financing options. My total was around 1,800. When I logged back on about an hour later, I went to check out, and all of my financing options are gone. The only option I am getting is 5% back. One of the benefits to the prime card is for every prime purchase over x amount of dollars, you have the option to finance it, but for some reason I’m not getting any finance options. I called Chase, and they said it was an Amazon problem, and when I called Amazon they said it was a Chase problem. Has anyone ever had this happen to them, and if so how did you get it resolved?"

CreditCards,"Hi everyone! 

I just passed my 1st anniversary on my Amex Gold a week ago. I went ahead and paid the annual fee since the CFF/CFU revamp wasn't announced at this point, and I planned on keeping the card open. With the Chase changes in mind, it seems as if continuing my membership isn't worth it.

If I cancel my gold card, will I still receive a refund for canceling within 30 days of the fee posting if I've already paid it? If so, will it be deposited into my linked bank account, or is it more likely that I'll receive a check? 

Thanks for your help!"

I called Equifax and the woman was not understanding my question so I gave up on the call. Will they contact me for more information? I don’t want them to deny my dispute because there wasn’t any information provided. 

Any help would be great, as this is my first time filing a dispute.

Thanks! (Not sure if I’m in the right Subreddit sorry in advance)"
CreditCards,I’m looking to settle down on one trifecta in the future and was wondering which one is a better fit for me. I’m new to credit and just started building over a year ago.
CreditCards,"I have the Chase Trifecta with the CSP and I've accumulated a fair amount (100k+) of UR points over the years. I haven't had much of a specific plan for them other than to let them accumulate and at some point redeem them for a ""bigger"" travel purchase (ex. before the fun of 2020, a trip to Disney was one idea).

I know with the CSP, I have a few options when it comes to redeeming points. One is redeeming them for basically 25% off travel, another is transferring them to a travel partner which can yield more value. However, to redeem for travel, you have to pick something available through Chase, which seems like sometimes might exclude some cheaper options. Transferring to travel partners seems like a bit more work and you have to plan and future it out to some degree (maybe easy/straightforward for some, but I've never done this before.. although if the savings is significant enough, it might be worth figuring out).

With some of that background information in mind, here's my question. Would it make sense to ""liquidate"" my UR points using Pay Yourself Back to basically turn my points into cash, still get the 25% back, and throw that money in savings for whenever I'm ready for that bigger trip?

Some pros and cons I've thought of:

- I would be guaranteed to get the 25% added value easily
- Converted to cash, I wouldn't be limited to what I used this for (ex. if I wanted to book something not available through Chase)
- My points would also be ""safe"" converted to cash (ex. in the unlikely event my 10+ year old cards got cancelled, Chase does away with the points, reduces redemption value, etc. I would have already had them ""cashed in"")
- I would be missing out on potential added value by not transferring to travel partners (although I'm not sure how likely it is that I'd actually do this)
- I would no longer have a high point balance to take advantage of other new offers that might come out (but not sure what they might come out with that would really be better)
- I wouldn't have the option of upgrading to the CSR when I'm ready to book something to get 50% more value instead of 25% (this seems like maybe the biggest drawback, although I'm not sure if I would do it and I'm not sure how beneficial the added value would be after factoring in the higher annual fee)

 Is there anything I'm missing or not thinking about? What are your guys' thoughts, what would you do in this position? What have you done since Pay Yourself Back has come out?

Thanks in advance for any feedback!"
CreditCards,About 2 weeks ago I did a PC from CSP to the no fee Saphire. I’m thinking that I would benefit more from the Freedom Flex than Saphire. Would Chase accommodate another PC? I know CFF isn’t out until 9/15 but is it a call worth making?
CreditCards,"Hello all,

I'm looking into any potential visa credit cards that offer cashback at a 2% rate, though preferably more, at Costco.

I am not interested in the Citi Costo Card and the only card I so far am looking at to fulfill this requirement is the Signature Federal Credit Union Rewards Visa.

What cards/combos do yall use to eke out as much cashback in-store at Costco as possible?"
CreditCards,"Is it possible to upgrade an existing Amazon Synchrony store credit card to the Chase Visa? 

Store card was opened 3 years ago and has a limit of $10k, never missed a payment, received over $1500 in the 5% prime cash back over the years. 

I’m guessing no because different banks but figured I’d ask since closing store card/applying for Chase Visa will hurt credit score but Visa is easier to use at Whole Foods and other stores. Does Amazon offer any way to “upgrade” ???"
CreditCards,"I don't have the Amazon card yet but was planning on getting it soon, but I was just wondering if I am over 5/24 would it be an instant decline since it is technically through Chase?

CreditCards,"I have a dilemna. I just applied to the chase freedom card and have yet to know whether I will be accepted or not. I learned today that the freedom flex is set to come out soon. This is significantly better for me since I would make good use of the 3% cash back on dining. 

I got a letter in the mail regarding the chase freedom card saying I needed to provide proof of my income. I was planning to send this out tomorrow, but I would prefer to have the freedom flex. Which leads me to a few questions.

1. If I don't send my info and they discontinue my application, did they already make a hard pull on my credit? 
2. If I continue with my application for the chase freedom, how long must I wait to product change to the flex, or should be able to do it as soon as I get the freedom?
3. Will the bonus still be available if I product change soon after I get my new card?

Thank you!"
CreditCards,"I got prequalified for the plat, gold and green. The best SUB offers was the gold which was 75k/$4k/6 months. So I pull on that one. I really want the plat as well. How long will I have to wait until I to apply for that one. I kind of want to wait until I see the 100k or if I’m crazy lucky 125k. I also went on the prequalified page when I’m logged in to my account but I don’t think it says I’m prequalified for the plat or green anymore. Did my prequal went away once I got the gold?

Also is there a difference between Charles Schwab plat and the regular one?"
CreditCards,"Chase is sort of throwing down the gauntlet with the upcoming Freedom Flex and changes to the Freedom Unlimited.

I'm wondering if other banks will upgrade some of their cards to stay competitive? Do you think Citi will add bonus categories to the Double Cash or Rewards +? What about Wells Fargo and the Cash Wise or Propel?"
CreditCards,"Ive been reading a lot of posts about credit line decreases across the board amd have been worried it might happen to me. 

Low and behold- I got an increase! From $1200 to $2500. 

Ive only had credit cards for 2 years now. Ive only asked cap1 for an increase they gave about 6 months ago- again only about $1000 increase. 

But Discoverit did it because of my ""overall excellent credit management."" 

Ive pretty much have followed the advice here.. Only using 10 to %15 of total of each card amd paying off. 

That feels great. Hopefully cap1 doesnt turn around and decrease theres. 

Cant wait to break $5000 credit line on a single card."
CreditCards,"It's been almost 1 year since I got my CSP and I really contemplate to upgrade to CSR for points.

I'm planning to buy new IPhone12 and IMac and saw this below post saying I can get 10x reward upto $1,500 which will end by 9/30.

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/igoc7v/csr\_10x\_rewards\_at\_apple\_store/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/igoc7v/csr_10x_rewards_at_apple_store/) 

I already opened up CF and CFU to maximize trifecta and heard CSR annual fee would be cheaper for this year too. It sounds good opportunity for me to upgrade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until travel becomes safe, I will probably use most of my points to PYB on grocery and dining.

Could you guys please give me an advice? Should I just stay on CSP?"
CreditCards,"Hi crew, I'm starting an online store and have spent the better part of two weeks figuring out what business credit card to get. A lot of that time has been trying to figure out which of these two to pick:

1) Capital One Spark (or Select)

2) Wells Fargo Business Platinum 

Now the reason I've struggled so much is that they offer very similar features (it seems), however Spark is rated much higher across the internet. But WF seems to have updated a lot of their offer to actually mimic the Spark with cash back, promotion, et cetera. I've also picked these two because I need no foreign transaction fee (took a lot of cards out of the running), and am opting for cashback.

Has anyone had experience with one or the other? The only real thing holding me up on the Spark because I'm a slave to good reviews is that they report directly to personal credit bureaus. However I""m dropshipping so very little upfront investment that could cause issues and don't plan on spending more than I have for the most part."
CreditCards,"Hi all,

Just wanted to clarify on terminology. What is the difference of ‘x’ vs ‘%’? For example, in the case of CSR vs. CF rewards."
CreditCards,"Hi,

I'm originally from New York, but I'm here in LA, California for college (currently in my senior year). I recently applied for my first credit card, and I listed my apartment in LA as my address (I initially wanted to receive the card here in LA but in hindsight, it would've been smarter to use my NY address). I've been asked to submit proof of my current physical address. I submitted my lease agreement but it was considered ineligible. The utility and Internet bills are all under my roommate (we split the fees through him), so my name isn't on any of the documents.

My permanent address (i.e. the address listed on all of my government ID) is back at home in NY.

Since I don't have any acceptable way to verify that I live in my current apartment, I want to use my permanent address instead of my LA apartment. Is the credit card company trying to verify that I live in the address I applied with or my permanent address? I can easily provide my U.S. government-issued ID if the latter."
CreditCards,"As a CF holder of less than a year, I'm still in their 0% APR promotion. Since Freedom Flex is technically a new card, does anyone know if a product transfer to CFF will essentially renew the $200 welcome bonus and 0% ARP window? 

If not, I assume it would make more sense to open CFF as a new card in order to gain those bonuses."
CreditCards,"My personal experience has been that I seem to have gotten the highest initial credit limits from Discover, Amex, and Chase (the Sapphire Reserve). Has this been your experience too? Any others? Hoping to get a new high-limit card with a long 0% introductory APR on purchases."
CreditCards,"Say next year I want to refer my chase freedom card, would it work and would bonuses still work?"
CreditCards,"Hey all! 

Given the recent announcement of the CFF, I was wondering: are used phones protected under World Elite? My girlfriend and I both bought our phones through Swappa (7T, Pixel 3a). Would our phones be protected if we make monthly phone payments, or the fact we went through unofficial channels disqualifies us?

Also: which carriers are accepted under World Elite? I've seen some DPs suggesting Visible is accepted, but I'm not seeing a fully featured list in MasterCard's documentation. I was thinking of going with Cricket since they handle monthly payments; I'd hazard a guess I should be covered there. Thanks in advance!"
CreditCards,"I applied for the Chase Freedom card on August 24 and was declined immediately. They said they would mail me the reason and the reason was because of ""Not enough accounts opened long enough to establish a credit history"".

I am in the process of building a PC, so I was wanting to take advantage of the sign up bonus of the Chase Freedom. Unfortunately I was declined. Should I apply for the Freedom Flex even though I recently just got rejected for the Freedom? If I do apply and get rejected, will it greatly impact me credit score? Should I just wait to apply?"
CreditCards,"Hi, I have opened a 5 credit cards for last 2 years. Which makes me unqualified for any chase cards. However, I am thinking if closing last credit card account will help me to be qualified for a chase card? Because basically I would have just 4 active cards opened for last 24 months.
What do you think?"
CreditCards,"I got a Chase Freedom in June of 2019. My question pertains to if I can receive a signup bonus for opening a separate CFF (at any point, or if I need to wait 2 years, etc.), since it is a separate product from the CF?

Additionally, since it is stated that you cannot have multiple CFFs, do we know what people will do concerning upgrading and downgrading Sapphires into no AF cards?"
CreditCards,"I found myself wanting to stick with the Bank of America Cash Rewards card as my first choice because one of my relatives built her credit to 780 being an authorized user on an AMEX Platinum for 3 years, and having the BOA Cash Rewards card for 3 years, too.

But can different cards actually build credit faster or slower than others, or do they all build your credit at the same speed.

Let's take the consideration that we are comparing two people with identical stats (Credit, income, monthly spend, utilization, history, credit lines open, and how much they spend on their cards, etc etc), but they are just using two different cards. These cards can be any combination."
CreditCards,"I am contemplating upgrading from my CSP to CSR and paying the annual fee with PYB via spend from the last few months. Currently, I have the AMEX trifecta (Plat, Gold, BBP) and the quasi Chase one (CF, CFU, CSP). I essentially only use the CSP for non-AMEX dining, non-flight travel and Doordash to use the DashPass. I could claim $455 on PYB at 30,334 points via $0.015 redemption (I think) on previous spend. But I would get instant value of $460 on the CSR for the $300 travel credit, $60 Doordash credit and $100 global entry which can be used for my 2 month old baby, which we would inevitably get at some point. So this works out to about $0.3 per point. I think this is a good plan due to CFU making CSP more or less dead in the water and might be a good preventative measure before any potential devaluation that could come up. Thoughts? Am I thinking this out correctly?"
CreditCards,"Around a month ago I got approved for my second credit card. It has yet to complete a billing cycle. I have never missed a payment on my first credit card.

* Oldest account: 1 year 2 mo
* Average age of accounts: 7 mo
* Chase 5/24: 2/24
* Utililization: 23%

I would like to get the CF card before it becomes unavailable, mostly for the SUB but also for the increased limit on spending categories in conjunction with the CFF. Given that I recently applied and was approved for a credit card, ~how likely do you think it is that I'd be accepted for the CF? My first card's billing cycle ends after the CF will become unavailable so that isn't a factor. My second card has a negligible balance so that shouldn't be a factor either. I just called chase to check that I could still get the card even if I am accepted after it becomes unavailable and a rep confirmed that. Given that information, I think waiting until the 14th to apply would give me the best chances of being accepted. What do you think? Do you think it's worth a hard inquiry?"
CreditCards,"About me:

Self-employed as a sole proprietor and am looking at both the business and personal card options for over a year now. I've had some bad luck with Chase since then. I've applied twice since the beginning of 2019 (so about 1.5 years now) and was auto-rejected every time due to ""too many hard inquiries.""

**Main Questions:**

1. **What is the likelihood I'll get approved for either/both of these cards?** (On the Chase Prequalified page, they weren't able to match me to any offers, but it's been that way for a year now.)
2. **Have you heard if Chase is now accepting Sole Proprietors again for Business cards?** (Around March of this year I think it was determined they auto-rejected all sole-prop apps.)
3. **IF I qualify for both cards, is there an optimal order to apply?** (I want both, so do I apply for the Business card first, since that doesn't count towards Chase 5/24 right?)"

CreditCards,"I'm literally an idiot.

I have 2 cards. One 8 months old the other is 6. In june I applied for 3 cards at once hurting my score a little and all rejecting me. Is it soon enough to get another card? I need the score to buy a house.

My score is currently 713 but I want to get to 800 within 12 months."
CreditCards,"I had applied for limit increases for citi and capital 1 bank last week. To my surprise I got declined from both. When I checked my credit score on chase, capital one, and credit karma it showed 740 and now this weeks it’s 750. I got letters in the mail saying the reason why I was declined was because my score was too low, Cap said it was 644 and Citi said 627. 

I don’t want to run into this problem again, how can I make sure my card is at the highest or get a more accurate estimate of my score? 

How many Months should I be staying under my 30% utilization or keeping a close to zero score before applying for new cards or asking for limit increases."
CreditCards,"I've had a checking account with Chase for years. When I click on the credit cards section, it looks like I have some credit cards offer. It says ""Because you are a Chase customer, just provide the information below and get a decision on seconds!"". I only need to enter total annual gross income &amp; phone number. Does it mean because I'm a Chase customer, they will not do a hard inquiry if I apply for a credit card in the offer? I called them to make sure but I got two different answers. Please help me understand. Thanks."
CreditCards,"Hey guys! I am a college student, 20 year old girl trying to get into personal finance. I was wondering a couple of things. Here’s my info first:

Credit cards: Wells Fargo Cash Back College Card, $1500 limit, February 2019
FICO Score: 717
Oldest Account Age: 1 year 6 months
Debt: $19,084 (student loans, currently paying it off ~1k a month) 

Basically, I want to build my credit more but I know now the Wells Fargo Card was probably a mistake (I heard an awful lot about them now getting into it). But I already had my checking account with them for about 4 years so I just assumed to get my credit card from the same place. Should I cancel this card and get a new one? Or just keep this one open? I called them yesterday and negotiated another 6 months of 0% APR so I have that for another 6 months (again) but it goes back to 18% after, is it even worth it? I pay off my account every month in full so it doesn’t *really* matter but should I just keep the account open since it’s my “oldest” account and open a better card? Also, should I switch my accounts over entirely?

I’ve been looking at the discover card or maybe a chase one? And moving my debit to Schwab or Vangard? Any help is appreciated!"

CreditCards,"So I recently got my chase freedom unlimited 2 weeks ago but after the announcement of the freedom flex I was looking to apply for the freedom flex and pair it with my freedom unlimited to take advantage of the rewards.I don’t want to product change but instead apply for a new credit card and I’m under 5/24 rule.If I apply for the freedom flex am I still eligible for the 200 bonus when you spend 500$ or more ? And if I get the card can I transfer points.I am new to chase so I don’t know how it works ? Will chase deny me since I just got a card with them two weeks ago ?

CreditCards,"If I'm understanding it correctly..

If I can keep my credit utilization to 10% which is doable, then my credit score will increase. Correct?

How much point will it be increased by usually?

How often do Capital One and other card companies report to the credit bureau within a month? Does it differ from one company to the next? I'm just curious because I heard it's possible to increase my score in a week.

How do I utilize a balance transfer card to help me increase my credit score?"

Key changes (summarized by u/MajorLCarter)

Freedom Unlimited will receive the following categories:

-	5% back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards
-	3% back on dining
-	3% back at drugstores
-	Flat 1.5% back on everything else

The regular Freedom will be sunset. A new “Freedom Flex” launches in its place. It will include:

-	Now a MasterCard instead of Visa
-	Rotating 5% categories like the old Freedom
-	5% back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards
-	3% back on dining
-	3% back at drugstores
-	1% on everything else"

CreditCards,"I use an Amazon Store Card. Over the past 2 months, I've opened just 1 other mastercard (visa) and that is it. I got a notice that my score went down but not by a lot. 

If I'm approved, do I have to now just use the Prime Rewards Card? Am I stuck with it, or can I go back to my Amazon Store card with Synchrony because I really do believe that it's better than the Rewards Card (this one seems to be from Chase) any experience with both?"

CreditCards,"Hi folks. I have an Amex Plat that I used to purchase a Beauty Rest mattress ($950) two years back. However, i did not purchase it directly through their website and used Wayfair instd. Problem is, some springs on the mattress are no longer in their place, as in have come out of their individual sleeve coils - the mattress is toast and painful to lay on.

I have filed a warranty claim with Beauty Rest directly, but not heard back. Followed up with an email, which also seems to have fallen on deaf ears. (uggghh!)

Can I used Amex Warranty Protection for this? If no, what other suggestions do you guys have for me?

THANK YOU!!"
CreditCards,"Hi all, quick question:

I am going to try to get my Quicksilver One 39 dollar annual fee waived for the first time this year. Product changing to Quicksilver w/ no AF isn't possible. Anyway, if they stonewall me on waiving the annual fee in retentions, and I cancel the card, do I still have to pay the 39 dollar fee? I will be cancelling it the day the annual fee posts.

Just wondering the annual fee gets cleared off if you cancel right after it posts, or if there's a grace period. Thank you."
CreditCards,"Hi everybody. This may be a dumb question and if it is I apologize in advance. Obviously we all want to pay off our balances to zero every month, but sometimes life happens. With that said, why should somebody want an Amex Gold or Platinum card? From my understanding they are charge cards that require being paid off completely each month. So what happens if you simply can’t pay it off by the due date?"
CreditCards,"I looked at Chase's transfer partners and, to my surprise, wasn't able to find a single flight that beat the Chase Travel Portal. The closest I saw was a 6000 point flight with Southwest (with 1 stop) but the Travel Portal offers the same flight for only 5400 and it's also non-stop.

I am planning to travel one-way from SFO to DFW/DAL and I currently have 150k UR points on the CIP. I'm okay with flying Coach and I'm the only passenger. My desired date of travel is 10/1/20.

I thought the Chase Travel Portal was supposed to be a baseline for the transfer partners, and you should generally expect higher value from the partners but that hasn't been the case in this particular instance. Did I miss a transfer partner that would beat Chase's Travel Portal? Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"
CreditCards,"I have very few credit cards and I'm at 0/24 with a FICO score of 755. I was looking to get a card that I use for travel since right now I just have a basic Chase Freedom. I don't do too much credit card spending since my main expenses (rent and student loans) do not accept credit card payments. I noticed that you only need to spend $1000 in 90 days to get the points offer and the card has an AF of $95, which to me is preferable to cards where I have to spend $4000 in 90 days. However, there is a 0% chance I would spend the $30000 required to receive the companion ticket from AA. Is this card still worth it for me or should I look elsewhere?"

I know that if I get the normal freedom and then later get the flex I'll only get the one SUB, but would it be worth getting both if one is UR points and one is cash back?"
CreditCards,"With the Ducks card gone/nerfed for new people, and Chase introducing 3% dining and 5% on travel through Chase portal on the Freedom line (already a CF owner) - WF propel doesn't make sense for me anymore (was gonna be next card). I don't spend enough on gas to make any card with a $25 minimum redemption worth it, as it would be years before I could redeem. I don't think there's anything out there and I should just stick with my AMEX BCE for 2% gas (because I earn/spend enough on groceries to redeem 3% back from that multiple times a year) - but I just wanted to ask here to see if there was a card I missed."
CreditCards,"Wait to get a credit card?

Hello so I am in the process of trying to think about a new credit card to get. As a bit of background I am about to turn 23 and I will be getting married around when I turn 24. So as I start this new chapter I want to get a card that will give me the best rewards as I would like to travel a decent bit. However, I am living at home still because I recently graduated from college and am waiting on a job to move out. So, my first question is: should I wait to get a card as I am not sure my true spending habits by not living fully on my own yet? Or should I go for a card that matches what I believe my spending habits will be? I assume the smart thing was the first option but I want to start getting benefits and rewards that I can take advantage of. And some credit history for me is that I have the discover student card which I have had for 3 years now. Never missed a payment and always the full amount. However, I do have a fluke collections account on my credit report for a medical bill that was paid over the phone but was apparently never told that the payment didn’t go through. And the excuse to not contact me was that they had the wrong number. That has since been paid and was only like $130. So another question is, is there a way to get that off my credit report before I apply because I was in the mid 700’s but that instance dropped me 100+ points. Thank you for reading and taking time to answer!"
CreditCards,"My travel has reduced and my primary spending is dining now. Already have a CFU
1. With 3% dining  in CFF, can I downgrade to CFF?
2. Got my CSR in July 2019. So post July 2021, if travel improves, can I apply for new CSR and get a SUB too?
3. If 2 is ok, I won't be using any of my UR points I hadn't from my CFU and CFF till I get the new CSR. If chase still allows transferring points then, can I move all the points from CFF and CFU to the new CSR and get the 1.5 back for them?"
CreditCards,"I checked my scores when I woke up. Credit Karma gave low 800s for TU and EQ, but I took those with a grain of salt because it's VantageScore. When I saw 819 from Experian.com, my jaw dropped. My original plan was to grab some beginner cards but I didn't expect my score to be this high! I've read that FICO 8 has some anti-piggybacking measures that favor spousal/parent-child relationships and I had figured I'd be disqualified for being adopted (my dad is my biological uncle though, with the same last name). 

Yet the accounts clearly count, so I'm hoping to leverage this to get higher tier cards than I ""deserve"" right away. I've seen discussion on how X or Y bank doesn't care about AU, but never about which ones do care - does anyone have insight on this?

* Current Cards:
 * 13 AU cards ranging up to $28,000 &amp; back to May 2005
* FICO Score: **819 EX**, others unknown
* Oldest account age: **1 year (federal student loan)**
* Income: **$40,000**
* Average monthly spend and categories:
 * Dining: $100
 * Groceries: $300
 * Gas: $50
 * Travel: $0
 * Other: $300 (plus ~$2K in business expenses)
* Open to Business Cards: **Very yes! See below\*.**
* What's the purpose of your next card? **Building credit and travel. I'll likely just hoard points until it's safer to travel, though.**
* Do you have any cards you've been looking at? **For non-beginner cards, I have no idea - I was going to see what banks I should even consider first.**
* Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card? **I'm down for whatever! :D**

If this isn't likely to work, I'm perfectly happy to go with my original plan of student cards. And ideally a CFF/CFU as well - I'm hoping my early payments on my loans and the Chase savings account I've had since I was 13 will help with that.

\*I actually kinda have a business already and am registering an LLC today now that I'm an adult. I'm estimating ~$20K annual net (not included in income given earlier, which is from my internship, campus job, and financial aid), but I'm not sure I can prove it until I've been doing this longer, so I hadn't planned on putting it in any applications."

CreditCards,"Hi,

For background, I got the CF 6 months ago. With the CFF releasing, I don't want to product change my CF to CFF because I want to apply for the CFF direct to get the SUB (I'm 2/24). So, I'll have a CF and a CFF.

My question is that if I then product change my CF to a CFU (to have 1 CFU and 1 CFF), will I be eligible for the CFU SUB since it's a product change? The same question goes for if I instead decide to product change my CF to a CSR in 6 months (instead of a CFU)... will I be able to get the SUB?"
CreditCards,"So I just got my capital one platinum today and immediately paid my phone bill with it.

So 3 days before due date I just decided to pay what I owed (even though it said I owed 0$) and it says I have the scheduled payment for 8/31 (due 9/2) but it has yet to post and I'm worried I won't pay on time.

Any advice?

CreditCards,"We miss out on 3% back on restaurants right? Or does that get added on 9/15?

CreditCards,"The Freedom Flex and Unlimited changes say you can get 5% back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards. Does this work if you purchase a flight in the UR travel portal *using* UR points or only if you use actual cash, or both?

Also - either way, why would you opt for this anyways considering you can get way more value with the 1.25/1.5x multipliers plus the access to travel partners that you get with the CSP/CSR?"
CreditCards,"My 1 year with the CSP is coming up and I was considering upgrading to the CSR as I already meet the 10k CL requirement. However given the recent changes to the freedom cards, would you wait it out to see if any new changes come to the CSP or CSR? 

CSP seems undervalued now with the new 3% dining and 5% UR travel on the freedom. I’m curious what they could add to the CSP to keep it at the mid-tier premium level."

I have the CF (and CFU) and I know I could just product change, but I feel like I would be missing out on a nice little SUB. I hope they revamp the CSR soon as well, so I can make a more informed decision. As of now I think I am just going to wait. Thoughts?"
CreditCards,"My Discover it student credit card maxes out at $1,750.

The camera store I'm renting from requires a security deposit for the retail value of the lenses in the form of cash or card. The guy on the phone said my security deposit will be around $3,500 for the 2 lenses I need. He seemed confident that it wouldn't be an issue if I used my credit card, but I'd feel better if someone here gave me their thoughts. The other options are withdrawing cash from my bank account which I'd rather not do, or use a debit card. The store rep said debit cards are ""harder to deal with"" though but could work if I had to.

CreditCards,"I have a Marriott Bonvoy Amex card with an annual fee of 450 dollars.

I also have a Delta card with an annual fee of 450 dollars.

I live out side of NYC so both cards worked well before the corona virus.  I would get multiple hotel stays for free in NYC and other places we visited.  One night stay in NYC in a nice hotel is 450 dollars and they give you a free night each year.

Same deal with the delta card.  You get a free companion flight anywhere they fly, and points added up for additional flights.

But now I don’t see us staying at a hotel or flying for the next year or more.

If I cancel both cards, what happens to my flights/points???

I don’t want to spend 900 in annual fees to maybe use my points.

Thanks

Edit/Update-  looks like I paid the Marriott annual fee in May, so I will cancel next May.  The main reason I was going to cancel was because their point redemption changed.  I used to be able to get a hotel in NYC for 50,000 points.  Right before Covid I tried to book a hotel in NYC and they wanted 153,000 for a standard room.  That’s insane- I need to spend 150,000 for one night and pay an annual fee.  No Thanks!!

I am prepaid on the delta until November as well.

I asked if they would give a prorated refund on the annual fee and the answer was nope!!!"

I tried applying for the chase amazon prime card but was denied. I called and was told I was denied because I don't have an old enough line credit. I then tried to apply for the capital one quicksilver card but was denied for that too. At this point, I'm worried that all these hard inquires are gonna make it more difficult to actually get a card / lower my credit, and I'm worried that there may be no options that I qualify for.

CreditCards,"I have recently (yesterday) checked in in a furnished apartment, but right upon check-in I have had issues with it. The apartment had a very strong smell that is still not gone, was dirty (definitely no special COVID-19 cleaning) and not well kept (dirty walls and baseboard, from what looks like food), had less furniture (e.g. no patio furniture) than shown in pictures, no curtain on the windows, blind only, and I am not fully confident in using some of the appliances (e.g. dryer has clogged filter and could potentially be a fire hazard). Some of the object provided are so dirty they are not usable. I am currently in CA, and renting the apartment was not cheap.  
I have been talking with the business and they were responsive and available to help, but considering the service offered the first time I am not confident they can deliver. They offered to move me to a different unit, which is better than my current one, but level of cleaning still not satisfactory, still has issue with unkept dryer, etc.

I am considering disputing the charge (Amex), but would want to understand what are the chances to get a refund in these cases.

Company offered a good customer service to answer to an overall bad service, would that be weighted in while evaluating the dispute?

Thanks for any advice!

CreditCards,"Hi everyone I have some questions about how to improve my current credit.  I am currently sitting right at 680 on credit karma. I am making my car and capital one credit card payments regularly for the past few months, but my credit has been pretty stagnate. I have been told that getting a second credit card would help increase my credit score, but I cant seem to find any good cards around my score range because it seems 700+ is when you really start to get good card options to choose from? So I have been thinking of getting a secured card through my bank (BB&amp;T), but not sure if thats the best move. Any tips would be appreciated.

I know it's not like a new release of a product where they'll 'sell out' of a credit card, haha, but not sure how new releases of credit cards work if they cut down on the unsaid 'requirements' of what scores, income, etc. that you need?

I want to replace it with a Visa card so I can use it at Costco, but don't want to get the Costco card because I may end up cancelling Costco in the future. I am leaning towards the Chase Freedom Unlimited. I also get 13 MPG so getting a gas card would be nice. 

Thoughts?"
CreditCards,"&amp;#x200B;

6/6/18 Discover Card  4k limit

7/6/20 Citi Double 7k limit

8/6/20 CSP 8k limit 

8/12/20 applied for Freedom, was asked to verify income. Sent it in and didn't hear back 

8/16 Approved for Amex Gold (had to bite with 75k bonus)

8/31 Called chase recon, application was declined due to too many applications in short time, not having Chase account open long enough, (income was verified but it did not matter)

I even offered to lower by limit on the CSP to get the FU but that still did not work. 

Did I mess up applying to too many? When should I try again? I really want the FU, especially now, but do not want to apply again to mess myself up again."
CreditCards,"So I'm thinking about getting the Citi Rewards+ Card for a balance transfer and I wanted to ask about this:

Get a **0% Intro APR** on purchases and balance transfers for **15 months.** After that the variable APR will be **13.49% - 23.49%** based on your creditworthiness.1

Balance transfer fee of $5 or 3% of the amount of the transfer, whichever is greater.1 Balance transfers need to be completed in the first 4 months of account opening.

Especially the last line about balance transfers need to be completed within the first 4 months. So say I apply and get approved on 9/1. Does this mean I have until 12/1 to complete a balance transfer AND when it completes, it's then 15 months from that date; or is the 15 month period starting whenever I start the new card."
CreditCards,"Hi cc enthusiasts! My wife recently opened a Best Buy card to get a good deal on a laptop. Shortly after, she got a preapproval for a 0% BT card from US Bank. I told her to apply for it and transfer the Best Buy balance over to it (Best Buy has really high interest rates). She asked if I wanted to also be on the US Bank card, and I told her yes, as long as I became an authorized user on the Best Buy card as well, so that I wouldn't only be affected by the balance on the new card, but the zero balance on the old card would help offset it.

Fast forward several months, the US Bank card shows on my credit report with a pretty high utilization ratio, but the Best Buy card is still nowhere to be found. I was there when she made me an authorized user on both so I know it happened. Is there a reason one would show and not the other? I have no plans to actually use either card, but now that the US Bank one is on there, I need the Best Buy one so my utilization goes down. Any advice would be appreciated!"
CreditCards,"I went through a divorce semi recently where we closed a lot of store cards as well as a few credit cards. When all was said and done I was left with a Macy’s American Express with a $5500 limit on it. It has over 30 years of all positive payment history as well as many closed out accounts that all still reflect positive history with no missed payments. I have an 800+ credit score.

Last year I decided to app for a chase card and was approved with a 27k limit.

Fast forward to now I’m trying to decide on what the next card id like to apply for will be. I’m looking into Capital one , Amex , Discover , Citi , maybe a second card from chase or a card from my personal bank. 

What do you guys think would be my next best card that I can ensure getting a decent credit limit or at least one similar to the 27k I have from chase. I was thinking of apping for a second case with chase but feel like they will give me a lower limit then my first card. Also was thinking about apping with my bank where I have a good amount of assets kept in hopes that they would treat me well. Other then that it leaves Amex , Discover , citi and capital one. I’ve heard Amex does a 3x increase after a few months , and have heard capital one can be stingy as well as citi with limits. 

Open to any suggestions on what you guys think would be best and ensure a decent credit line right now. Thanks"

CreditCards,"After the news of the new Chase Freedom Flex, I was wondering if this would effect the 5% categories and wanted to hear y'all's opinions. Now that the card has a flat 3% on restaurants and pharmacies, will Chase still have restaurants and pharmacies in the rotation for the 5% quarterly bonus? Or would they remove them since the card now offers rewards on those categories all the time? This could even be asked about travel, will they only reward on purchases made in the Chase portal and not have travel as a 5% category? What do you think?"

CreditCards,"Hey guys,

Got a few questions that probably apply to others as well!

Need both a vehicle and personal loan at the same time for various reasons. Not a lot--about 7k for private used car sale, 3k personal. Might just get a new credit card instead if I dont qualify.

Score is solid (704) and I make about $5k per month. Very low living expenses. Problems are:


-Self employed

-Havent filed tax returns yet for 18 and 19 (extenuating reasons; about to file shortly)

-Even if I had filed, it prob wouldn't help. In 18 I made good money but in 19 I basically made zero. All freelance. Been earning $5k monthly for about 5 months now but that's only this year.


Anything I can do to maximize likelihood of qualifying? What institutions are most likely to approve this? I'm willing to pay a little bit higher rate if it means I get approved on the first try. Typically I've used USAA for car loans.

Thank you!

Edit: I actually can provide the complete tax return forms. I just technically havent filed them yet. Kinda doubt they'd check with the IRS"
CreditCards,"Hello! I'm basically trying to understand if it's a good idea to get the Discover IT Student Card mainly just to build credit, help the average age of accounts (in the future), and lower my future utilization rate.

I'm building towards the Chase Trifecta right now and I know Discover has a good 10% revolving categories for their sign up bonus so I wasn't sure if it makes sense to even use the Discover IT Student Card since I would be getting points split from 2 different companies (Chase and Discover)?

I don't have too many expenses right now as I live with my parents as a college sophomore but I also plan to get a car in about 8-9 months so I would rather get a card now so the hard inquiries won't affect my interest with an auto loan when I get one.

So I'm using the Amazon card for Amazon and the Costco Card for Costco, since I frequent them the most. But the next thing I use the most is Instacart and despite all the previous posts and comments, I'm still not sure what would be the best card for it. I'm not looking for a time frame card so maybe not the Freedom but I'm looking for something consistent, so I'm looking at 2% cashback cards and maybe one of the Amex Cards. Are there any other cards or suggestions I should consider?"

CreditCards,"Hi there, I'm Brian. I've been more lurking as I work nights and enjoy reading what everyone has to say but I could use some help.

I filed bankruptcy several years ago but had a little to no balance on my only credit card, Capital One. I stopped using it but didn't close it and it's been idle until today. I randomly saw an alert from Credit Karma about a 29pt drop from Transunion due to huge utilization from Capital One I'm not even using. A balance increase of almost 2k.

Do I call them directly, or the credit bureaus? Both? With the extended wait times to due Covid-19, I didn't want to waste my time if customer service is useless, one is more beneficial than the other, etc.

My credit score was in the 400's and up until today, I got it to 694-696 between Equifax and Transunion so I hope to have this resolved before it makes more of an impact. State Dept FCU is the only active card through the American Consumer Council.

I'm also asking for anything else suggested doing to help my score in general? I didn't want to open up any other cards to borrow money but as long as I watch what I spend I'm fine, especially with the intro rewards. I am in a much better place than even a year ago and hope to exit bankruptcy in the next few months.

I filled out what I could and will come back with the rest but I wanted to ask this now as I'm running out to do some errands.

Thank you!

I plan on building a PC soon with a budget of $1000 so I am looking for a card with a sign up bonus, which will also be useful over time. 

I’m a full-time university student living with my parents so my only expenses are gas (barely bc covid) and dining. 

Currently I’m considering both cards because of there sign up bonuses. I am leaning more toward  the Blue Cash Everyday card because there is a 20% cash back on Amazon ($200) limit in addition to it’s standard $150 SuB. I also use my current credit card practically as a charge card. On the other hand, Bank of America’s cash rewards card only offers a $200 SuB, but seems to have more applicable cash back.

Though the Blue Cash Everyday seems more favorable so far, I wanted to check with this subreddit to see if there’s anything I’m not considering.

CreditCards,I want to close a credit card with a high annual fee. How does that affect my Credit Score?
CreditCards,"So I’m new just got the CF this August, this is my second card. On the app it only tells my due date for my balance. However is this when my statement ends? I have a NFCU CC and my statement ends the 25th and i usually have to pay it back off before the end of that month to avoid the fees. However is the due date the same as a statement date? I’m confused. My due date is the 6th of each month so is that when I must pay everything off to avoid to the APR or is this the date my statement ends?"
CreditCards,"This may be a question with a very obvious answer but wanted to see - 

I downgraded my Amex Delta card (from Gold to Blue) via online chat a week or so ago (super easy) and they said the card would arrive in 7 to 10 days. I had to go out of town today and won't be back home for another three weeks, so I won't be able to start using it until then. Amex refunded me a percentage of the Gold card annual fee (since the Blue card is $0 annual fee). If I continue using the Gold card until I can activate the Blue card, will Amex start chipping away at that refund?  

Honestly whatever the answer is. its pretty much a non-issue since the amount refunded is pretty negligible and I have other cards anyway to use in the meanwhile - but asking more out of curiosity. Thanks!"

So depending how much you spent last month compared to this month, does that effect the credit score average also?"
CreditCards,"I’m just getting into the credit game, and I set a goal of getting a round trip flight to Europe in First/Business class with points, along with aligning myself to attaining a high credit score.

Some of my stats are below, and my plan is below this:

* Current cards:
   * *No personal cards, but...*
   * *Amex Platinum (\*\*AUTHORIZED USER\*\*) 2 yrs 10 months*

**Step 1: CHASE Trifecta &amp; The 5/24 rule**

\- 1st card, since I bank with BOA. **Bank of America Cash Rewards Card** (Meanwhile open up a Chase bank account to build your relationship with Chase to receive the letter of recommendation before applying for the Chase card)

\- When I start buying my own food, due to the 60k points from grocery promotion: **Chase Freedom Unlimited Card** (No sooner than 6 months after you applied for the BOA card on \_\_\_\_). All spending will transfer to this card. BOA card will just receive a small rotating bill on autopay - *Like financing a vacuum and using the payments to build my credit*... #MURICA

\- **Chase Freedom Card** (No sooner than 12 months has passed from the Freedom Unlimited Card received on \_\_\_, because you want to get that double 60k points from grocery in a year bonus. Some spending will transfer from Freedom Unlimited to catch the 5% rotating categories

\- When you have a big purchase of $4000 coming up (No sooner than 8-12 months after you received the BOA card on \_\_\_\_), get the **Chase Sapphire Preferred Card**. If you don't see yourself doing much dining in the next year to take advantage of the 2x dining points, request a downgrade to the Sapphire Classic within 30 days of your annual fee posting to be eligible for a full refund

\- When you start paying for phone and internet, **Chase Ink Business Cash**. Unless you have $15,000 of expenses, then do the Chase Ink Business Preferred for the bonus, then in 12 months product switch to the Ink Business Cash to get that 5% on phone and internet.

\- Then when you start traveling, product change the Preferred/classic to the **Sapphire Reserve**

**Result:**

\- Freedom Unlimited: 20,000pts + 60,000pts = 80,000pts

\- Freedom: 20,000pts + 60,0000pts = 80,000pts

\- Sapphire Preferred: 60,000pts

\- Chase Ink Business cash: 50,000pts

\- Total, transferred to travel portal using Sapphire Reserve: **405,000 pts - A.K.A first-class round trip to Europe and a stay at the Ritz for a few nights!**

**STEP 2: AMEX (I want to stay with AMEX over Chase in the long run because I like the company more)**

\- If you have big purchases totaling $5000 coming up, get the **AMEX Platinum**. If you aren't going to be doing much traveling in the next year, cancel this card because downgrading this card to the AMEX Green will still put you out $150, and product changes from lesser cards to bigger cards with AMEX simply count as a new application. You'll just re-apply when you start traveling and can actually get profit from this card.

\- If you have big purchases totaling $4000 coming up (but can’t wait until you have $5000, or already got the Platinum), get the **AMEX Gold**. This will turn into your (if you dine) dining, and grocery card. Spending $6250/yr in groceries will break even on the annual fee of this card, so I can probably keep this one after year one.

\- If you have $2000 in purchases coming up, get the **AMEX Green**. Cancel after a year. You would already have the Gold card, so this one is entirely useless to you either than the welcome bonus

\- If you have a BIIIG purchase coming up, get the **AMEX Blue Business Plus** for a 0% APR on 12 months. Put the money in a high-yield savings account, and have it be paid off slowly. Also, replace the Freedom Unlimited with this card. Put a small bill on the Unlimited to keep it alive. This is simply another card history &amp; relationship with AMEX building card

\- A year after you get the vanilla platinum, get the **Schwab Platinum** for an extra MR Point boost. Cancel at the end of the year and make \*another\* AMEX Platinum card knife.

**Result:**

\- Amex Platinum: 60,000 - 125,000pts

\- Amex Gold: 60,000pts

\- Amex Green: 45,000pts

\- Schwab Platinum: 60,000 - 125,000pts

Total: **225,000pts - 355,000pts -** (definitely getting myself one of those $15,000 flights with these points)

Anything I should switch up, including timings between cards (AMEX card timings I'll figure out later, but if you'd like to pitch in now on those I would appreciate this), or is this fairly good to go and I can go ahead with getting my first card? Any additional recommendations to better capitalize on status benefits? Thanks :)"

CreditCards,"I'm trying to rebuild my credit after filing for BK 5 years ago due to a 9 month unemployment stint  which I was able to land a job, negotiate settlements  and pay off in full; the BK getting dismissed. 

I currently have a FICO of 704 (Experian FICO 8)  and 725 (Creditwise via Cap 1).  I currently have 2 Cap One MC and 1 Merrick (low credit limit) Visa open, 0$ balance across the board at the moment but I do use them and pay them on time, extra payments, and never late. I also have on the credit report 5 closed accounts, and 2 installment accounts (paid in full car loans). I have 2 inquiries on the report, 1 will drop off in a month. 

The various services I subscribe to all advise that I have too few credit cards and until just recently lower than normal credit available. I addressed the latter by getting a CLI on 2 cards and am at $15K avail across all 3 cards. 

I applied and got an Amex Gold in July which the inquiry hit the report already but not the new account itself, though I know being a charge card and not credit it won't help me much. 

I want to address the 'too few credit card accounts' by applying for another credit card. In my mind I'm thinking either a real Visa, Discover, or a Macy's card.

The issue is I plan on financing a car sometime within the next 3 - 6 months, and maybe a house in 3 - 5 years. I don't to screw up my approval chances by making it look like I'm applying for too much at once, or applying for things in the wrong order which could negatively impact the finance rate or approval of a car loan by having too many new accounts with not enough payment history.

Knowing the whole picture, what's the best plan of attack to get the best rate and chance of approval on the car? Additional credit card first or car loan first? And any other advice for rebuilding the credit report?"

I know pre-qualified does not mean guaranteed approval. But is it even a good idea to apply?

CreditCards,"I’m just curious has anyone ever gotten a business card before ever having a personal card. Sounds kind of counter intuitive. My dad has been self employed and running his own business for 30+ years. He’s never used a credit card and he’s paid off 3 car loans. Don’t ask me how he got approved for any of these since I was a kid. He has a decent credit score, above 750+ but I feel he might be missing out on on slight reward earning. I don’t think I’ll change his mind but I thought it be an interesting topic of discussion."
CreditCards,"I got the Amex Everday for the balance transfer rewards. Still in the 0% APR period until January, so looking to capitalize on that until then. 

I’ve paid off all my balances and have a pretty good handle on my spending now, so think I would be ok moving to a charge card. I’m not sure if it’s really worth it though, considering the below. But maybe could be after January? 

- right now I live at home, literally paying no rent, no food, just my phone bill. Thriving. Post July 2021 I’ll be moving back into paying rent (1500) , restaurants (200/m) , food (100/m) etc. 
- I’ve heard the AF for the Gold pays itself if you eat out a lot and I will/do when I go back to living by myself 
- FICO up to 760 right now, hoping paying off my balance will let that rise a bit more 
- have 2 other cards (CSPreferred, Capital One Quikcsilver) 

Any thoughts?"
CreditCards,I’m opening this thread to see what everyone considers to be their top 5 must have credit cards in 2020. Please give a brief explanation on why a specific card made your list. Thanks in advance!!
CreditCards,I have to pay $8000 medical bill. Which card would you recommend? I already have chase sapphire preferred and citi premier card.
CreditCards,Is the $100 opening fee for the cash rewards platinum plus MasterCard refundable while the account is open? Running into a financial bump and I’d be able to squeeze by with the refund if it’s applicable otherwise I’d have to max out the $500 limit. Asked for a limit increase but no luck as well with that’s it’s been 2 weeks and haven’t received as much as an email
CreditCards,hello! I went over my credit limit of $2000 on my Best Buy card by $347. What are the consequences? Or is it just fine as long as I pay it before the promotion ends. Currently have 2 promotions one at $680 some for 12 months no inst and $1680 for 24 months no interest.
CreditCards,"Hello,

Today, I applied for the CFU and was denied (with the 7-10 day denial message). 

I called recon, and I was told that the denial letter I would soon receive would request that I verify my income. They asked that I send two paystubs or a W-2 for income verification. 

I immediately sent the requested documents and am now in the waiting game. There was no fudging numbers—I reported my true income. I’m thinking it was likely flagged because this is my first job ever, as I have just finished graduate school. 

Is this likely a conditional approval, provided my income matches what I reported? Or is there still a chance I will be denied?

Stats:

AMEX Delta Gold Skymiles Card: (opened 7/2019, $10,000 limit)

FICO: 738

Income: $100,000/yr"
CreditCards,"Found someone’s Chime debit card on the street. The customer service number is completely automated, no way to get a person (I tried pressing zero, etc.). No chat feature on their website. I emailed the Chime support, but not sure when I will hear back. Anything else I can do to report this?"
CreditCards,"Looking for a card that fits that ""everything else"" category. I know the obvious pick is to go for the Double Cash due to the higher reward rate but I have heard horror stories about Citi's customer service from people I know personally and other users on Reddit. I would much rather take the half a percent cut if it meant I wasn't pulling my hair out in the event that I ever need to contact customer service, but I want more input since I'm sure you can find negative reviews for any bank so long as you ask the right people. What do you guys recommend? Is the customer service at Citi really THAT bad? If so, is it worth that extra half a percent? Or is it not that bad after all? I have already ruled out the Fidelity card as I already bank with UBS and last time I checked the Paypal 2% card is not compatible with apple pay (big apple pay guy here) so I think the CFU and C1QS are the only other options available. Also just curious, do the QS and FU cards force you to redeem $25 of cashback at a time like the DC? 760 credit score here so getting any card should not be an issue."
CreditCards,Thinking of getting this one based on my groceries but not sure if these Asian ones count even though their HQ are in America. Anyone know?
CreditCards,"I still got plenty of time before I actually feel the desire to pull the trigger on a travel card (i.e. global pandemic), but I'm curious how much redditors make out with after the fee, and when they consider it to be worth it in their opinion over just using regular cards. I know people who fly for their job often obviously believe this card is worth it, but I do at least one major trip a year for leisure.

For my use case, I compared the CFU (by itself), the CSP (with the CFU), the CSR (with the Trifecta), and the USB AR.

In terms of general spending within a given year, no unexpected purchases, and one major trip a year, I estimated the following so far ***after*** the fees and travel credit (no Covid bonuses included):

* CFU: $110.70 (I would not use this card overseas, as my Prime card has no FTF so I did not include overseas spending for the CFU)

* CSP (with CFU): $176.65 the first year, $81.65 after that (I'd upgrade/downgrade to CSR/CF after the first year)

* CSR (Trifecta): $92.20

* AR: $135.68 (for anything I was not 100% sure would allow mobile wallet such as restaurants and overseas spending, I calculated as 1x to calculate the least I would earn with this card)

I know I calculated these in terms of cashback but I'd expect with all the cards (other than the CFU) I would use their portal.

Now in the Chase ecosystem, it appears that while I would make enough to cover the fees and then some, putting the benefits aside (and first year CSP waived), I make more back on the CFU. Though outside of these cards, I always buy travel insurance and have always wanted to use those lounges.

More and more, the AR is looking better and better to where I'm considering opening up a no-fee brokerage with them to establish a relationship with them in advance to prep for the AR (since I don't have a US Bank near me).

Now that's not to say I wouldn't use the benefits of the CSR and AR. I would absolutely love complimentary wifi (though every flight I've taken lately has had Panasonic wifi instead of gogo, so...) lounge access, TSA Global Entry and included travel insurance (I'd still buy travel ***medical*** insurance separately, but I could buy just the medical rather than a whole comprehensive plan that costs $100 extra), so those would not go unused. However, I do know that what I would gain from the card is undoubtedly minimal compared to some of the other cRedditors on here so I'm curious what other people make out with these cards after.

Thanks in advance!"
CreditCards,"Like many people, when I was deciding whether or not to apply for the CSR I used to search for stories of people who applied and got accepted. I decided to throw out my info at the time I applied in case it helps anyone else. I was nervous but finally decided to just end the suspense and hit the apply button.

CreditCards,"I'm currently running a Prime membership to Amazon, and a sweet deal just popped up in my cart before purchase. ""Get $60 off instantly upon approval for the Amazon Prime Store Card."" It would be my first card, and it seems you can only use the card in Prime, but I don't want to use it ever. Can I just take the $60 and run off scotch free without having to pay anything back?"
CreditCards,"Is there any merit to applying for a credit card and understating income in hopes of going back several months later and then giving your real income so that a higher limit can be achieved through the credit limit increase?

Or do issuers like Discover tend to give ""full"" credit limits from the get-go?

CreditCards,I don’t have any credit like it’s 0 and i’m in college and wondering how i should start the process of getting a credit card and which company’s are best with lowest interest rates and best benefits.

 My FICO is 740
Income is over 30k
And I have 4 years credit history spread across all accts.

I'd want to apply for the card sooner rather than later because I have other hard inquires in the near future that require a lower FICO. So the question is, if I apply now, and get accepted can I wait apprx 4 months to activate? I read it's 6 months before they close the acct, but are their any other things to look for?

Finally, if I transfer my $700 balance from discover, over to the chase card,  would that count towards the 4k spent promotion?"

I just think now is a good time to start so I have an easier time in the future. Just need some advice on what I need to know, and where I need to start.

edit: I ended up applying for the Chase student card, since I’ve been with chase for a long time. I already have a history with them. Now I just need to wait to see if I get accepted or not."
CreditCards,"Hello,

Just wondering how the points is calculated,
For most purchase, it looks like I'm only getting 2x instead of 3x. For example, my purchase for $5 is only giving me 10 rewards point. And a lot of purchase with the code 3095 doesn't trigger the 3x bonus at all and shows up like a normal purchase while other 3095 does show up as ""3x"" rewards."

CreditCards,"Hi. This is my first time posting here so sorry if I made some errors, please let me know if you find one.

I am now a Junior in high school in Southern California as a South Korean international student (NOT an exchange student), and I am getting a green card soon because of my mom’s investment thing in San Fransisco. As stated in the title, I am 17 year old and turn 18 next July.

While looking things up on Google, I found some ways to get my credit scores higher and one is churning. Take a look at what I wrote based on all those things on Google and Youtube:

——————————— THESE ARE THE THINGS I WROTE DOWN ON MY NOTE———————————————

1. Get a Chase bank account in prior to getting a green card and SSN as an international student. Use the savings account and have a certain amount of money in there for at least 6 months

2. Wait until I get the green card and become a legal permanent resident. (I think this will be around my sophomore year in college)

3. Make a secured card from USBank/ Citi/ Chase/ WF/ BoA/ Capital One/ Discover and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 750-790 is expected, but a fragile one.

4. Get a CF or CFU and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 800 or near that is expected, but still a fragile one.

5. Get credit cards from each companies (Amex, Chase, BofA)

After 6 months, I would be able to lease a Honda  Accord or Toyota Camry (Maybe?)

- The credit score can easily go down, so I have to have a mortgage or a car loan to make it a sturdy credit score
- Try to do things above online not on the phone or in person unless the bank calls you or bank wants you to call them
- I can use other cards from Korea or use my debit card when I can’t use my credit cards because of the limit

———————END OF THE NOTE———————-

What do you guys think about this? Please let me know and help me fix this if anything’s wrong here."
CreditCards,"I already posted this on r/personal finance but I would like to see other opinions. 

I wanted to build some credit history as an incoming college freshmen. For my first credit card, I applied for the Chase Freedom card a week ago, but I believed I had a low chance of getting approved so I applied for the Discover Student Card. Now I have 2 credit cards, but I would rather just keep the Chase Freedom (Since I already have my checkings and savings account with them) . I kind of want to close the Discover, but wouldn’t that negatively affect my credit score? Should I just utilize it one a year or something to maintain it or just close it off now since there isn’t any history with it to begin with?"
CreditCards,"My second annual fee for my AMEX Gold is coming up and I’m not renewing. I have around 100k Membership Rewards points that I haven’t spent. Please share your thoughts on the following three options:

1. Sign up for a Charles Schwab version of the AMEX Platinum. This would cost me $550, but earn another 60,000 point signup bonus with $5k spend. So my balance would be 165,000 points, cashed out would be $2,063 - $550 = $1,513

2. Take advantage of the current tax-free transfer to Delta SkyMiles that’s available through the end of 2020. This would be because **I’m most likely to use these points this way anyway**. I have my eyes on a Virgin Atlantic flight booked with SkyMiles. This would also put me under 5/24 to apply for a new Chase Sapphire Bonus when I hit 48 months in January. 

3. Apply for an AMEX Everyday and keep the Membership Rewards points alive in the most flexible form. This seems like the lowest risk and there might be some sale or changes that I could jump on. 

I’m ambivalent about these three choices, haha"
CreditCards,"I have two Discover It cards. One of the cards currently has a -$50 balance because I recently referred a friend. The other account has $1,000 in balance. Can I somehow get this credit transferred over to the second account?"
CreditCards,"I recently received a mailer for a cc w/ 0% for 18 mos on balance transfers. I dont have any credit card balances to transfer for a lower rate but I do have a personal loan with a crappy rate that would save me a ton if I were able to transfer the loan to this theoretical new card. 

Has anyone done this? I found a 2016 Nerd Wallet article that listed Citi as a bank that allows personal loans to be transferred. I just need some general advice here. I’m sure there’s things I’m not thinking of. Thanks. 

The mailer I received was from Citi. 
The personal loan has a balance of ~$18k."
CreditCards,"I'm Having trouble comparing these two cards since the mileageplus card is no longer offered. What benefits would I miss out on if i get the Sapphire? 

My reason for switching is supper petty. The raised embossing on my current card prevents me from sliding another card over it cleanly. I also have always wanted a metal card."
CreditCards,If I refer a friend to Chase Freedom for the $200 referal bonus do they also get the 5% back on grocery for 1 year?
CreditCards,So I recently got a medical collection removed from my credit after haunting me for 5 years (yay!). How long does it take for my score to go up?
CreditCards,"Hi everyone,

I just recently got approved for my first credit card on august 7th. My credit card company charged a $35.00 joining fee on august 7th as well. I made my first purchase the day I got my card (8/18) for $3.33 and haven't used it since due to my credit line being $300 and not wanting to have a high credit utilization. My question is: When do I make my first payment? The app that I use to check all my information has a blank by my payment due date and says my minimum payment due is $0.00. I don't want to miss a payment or something just because I don't know when to pay, but I also don't want to pay too early and not have my credit usage reported to the bureaus. Am i supposed to wait until I receive my statement? I feel like I have 85% of the information I need about credit, but just need someone to help fill some of the gaps in my knowledge. Any answer would be much appreciated!"
CreditCards,"I’ll make my question short and sweet: how much total debt can you have between all your cards and still have a good chance of being approved for new cards?

Why I’m asking: I use personal credit to finance business purchases. This has been extremely helpful as the terms are better than I can get elsewhere. I’m currently carrying a little over $30k. Even though my FICO is 750, I’ve discovered that I cannot get more cards with this amount of debt. I want to know how far I need to pay this debt down to get new cards.

I feel like someone is going to flame me, so please know I could pay this off tomorrow if I wanted under worse terms than the cards. :) thank you!"
CreditCards,"It would be interesting to know which method you found is better to pay credit card balance and why.

From my perspective:

* Debit card. The obvious disadvantage is that a fairly small number of credit companies are allowed to use this method. But the big advantage is safety and speed. It is also a chance to get cashback for paying your credit card bill. For example, at The Home Depot, it is possible to pay their Citi credit card balance with a Discover debit card and get 1% cashback.
* ACH debit. The typical advantage is that the payment is initiated by the credit institution, and even if ACH can be really slow, payment still will be considered credited on the same day when you submit a request. A small drawback can probably be the need to provide data and access to your checking/saving account to your credit institution. 
* ACH credit (with services like Bill Pay). The advantage is that you do not need to provide your account details to the credit institution. In some cases, it is convenient that, unlike the methods above, it is possible to overpay and cause a negative balance. This can be useful for people with a small credit limit or in rare situations when there is a risk that a large transaction on a credit card will be cleared on statement date (which can cause a report of big utilization and drop of credit score for this month). The downside is the difficulty in controlling the date when payment will be credited (as it is not initiated by credit card company). Some Bill Pay services may also send a check to payee instead of electronic transfer which can be unpredictable slow.

Some users may prefer to pay in cash or send paper checks. 

Share if I miss any important points, what methods you prefer and what the benefits might be (for example, like getting cashback when paying with a debit card)."
CreditCards,"Hi guys, quick rundown. I have 6 month credit history with Discover It Card. 699 TransUnion/ 704 Equifax and about 750 FICO. Always payed in full, just got caught once with 25% utilization but now I pay off before reaching 10%. ""Income"" would be 12,000 more or less since my parents deposit about $1,000 a month in checking account. I have 2 hard inquires though, one from July and another one on August. Thats the part that most worries me, I screwed up applying with PayPal, and Chase gave me a bunch of reasons for rejection, as would be expected with low income and low credit history lol. But this BOA card seems promising on paper with nice rewards. I would like to know if I should go with it. My second choice would be the Sams Mastercard which I could try and get with my mom as co-signer (not sure if its possible). But I would rather get the BOA one, much better rewards and bonus from the start. And I think I would apply by the phone since I'm from Puerto Rico and they can't seem to get my phone number and I don't want to waste my time/ credit score if I could do it the right way.

CreditCards,"Hi Everyone,

I have a quick consultation for Chase CC users in this reddit.  I noticed that my personal Chase credit cards have 3 days gap between Due Date (DD) and Statement Date (SD). I chose to consolidate my DDs on the 25th of each month, therefore their Statement Dates are on the 28th.

 I am trying to do the same for my Chase Ink Cash (business), however I noticed that the time gap between DD and SD is 6 days instead. My current due date is on the 16th and my statement date is the 22nd.

1. Do you guys have very similar time gap in your Chase business cards?
2. If I'm trying to match my statement date to the 28th, do you think I should change my due date to 25th or 22nd?

Thank you very much for taking the time of reading this post, and double thanks to those that take the time to reply. I really really appreciate your help!"

CreditCards,"Hey Reddit!

How come a high credit card utilization results in a lower credit score? Even if one pays off the balance entirely?

I have a card with a $2,500 limit. I charged $1,500 on the card last month and payed off every penny of it, several weeks early in fact. Still, that DEMOLISHED my credit score.

I think it’s ridiculous that this happens. If someone pays off their bills in their entirety and on time/early, why should it matter how much one charges? Please make this make sense. Personally, it seems like a useless policy in place only to hurt credit scores and promote a bad economy."

I'm not really sure what to make of this since there's been more than one report since I opened my most recent credit card, so it's old news that probably(?) isn't causing the drop. Does anyone have ideas for what this could be or where I should check to get a reason for this? Transunion still showing a 760s score for some reason. Not sure what other info to post but would appreciate any suggestions or ideas people have."
CreditCards,"Since I don't live in the US anymore, the spending categories for the CashRewards card aren't really relevant to me, unless I'm buying something online for family to bring when they visit. Discover actually upgraded my card to the travel one a couple of years ago without me enquiring, which would be great except Discover isn't widely accepted overseas.

Inevitably I end up using my BofA card when I travel, the last trip was to the UK and Spain, and the foreign transaction fees add up quite quickly. 

In 2017 I applied for the BofA Travel Rewards card and was denied because ""you already have a credit card with us"" or something along those lines. I haven't applied or been rejected by any other credit cards.

I hadn't realized I could potentially ""upgrade"" the card, I just saw a few posts mentioning that. Could anyone tell me a bit more about the process and if it's likely they'll accept?

I'm also planning on closing my BofA savings account and just maintaining the checking account, that wouldn't affect anything would it?

Thanks!

CreditCards,"Just got a new Discover It Miles card in the mail. It replaces my plain Discover It card. I don’t understand how the “miles” work. 

$1=1.5 miles | 1 mile=1 cent

Ex: spend $3,000, earn 4,500 miles OR $45 cash back. 

So, if I apply my accrued miles to a travel expense, does it just translate to $45 to travel? 

Really don’t understand how the whole miles thing works. 

Any help is appreciated."
CreditCards,"Hello!

So the title says it all. I’m heavily considering trying the AMEX Gold card as my main credit card instead of the AMEX Everyday I’m currently using. If I make this change, I’m also considering simply canceling the everyday card so I all of my focus can be on the gold, since I feel a little funky about having multiple credit cards open, especially for my lifestyle. 

If I do this, I originally was planning to cancel the everyday card and apply for the gold (no promises I’d be accepted of course) but was reading that AMEX apparently doesn’t like recent cancelations when applying for new cards. Does that mean it would be better to apply first and, if accepted, then cancel the old card?

I should mention that if it comes down to it, I’m sure I can be convinced to keep both cards open as well. You’re all the experts. I have an idea how this might go but it’s based on knowing nothing about the process. 

Thank you for your input!

EDIT: Thank you all again for your input! It looks like canceling the everyday card isn’t the way to go, so I’m gonna keep that one activated. With that said, I’m feeling even more confident about applying to the gold card, even though I’ll do an extra bit of research first. Better safe than sorry!"

CreditCards,"So I set up autopay for my Citicard in January.  I set it to pay my full balance on the 1st of the month (payments are actually due on the 6th).  I use another card most of the time and only have a couple recurring charges on the citi card in order to maintain the line of credit.

I still periodically check the app to make sure no one is fraudulently charging things, and today I noticed autopay did not go through on August 1st!  Autopay is still active and says next payment will be September 1st.

CreditCards,"I’m responsible with my credit cards and I recently got an Amex with a very generous limit so I’m not looking to increase it any time soon. That said, I’m curious as to how people achieve 10-15-20k+ limits on their credit cards? Are they charging enormous amounts monthly or annually to warrant that kind of limit? I don’t foresee myself spending (and of course paying off) more than at most 25-30% of my current limit on a monthly basis, perhaps over the course of a year that does total to over $10k+ in spend but I can’t foresee myself charging anything near that on a monthly basis such that a $10k limit would even be necessary. 

Perhaps I have the wrong idea about credit limits, but my understanding is you’re only given a high credit limit if you are also a reliable high spender (who will pay it off). For ex, if I were only charging $250 monthly on a good grocery rewards card, it’s unlikely I’d be given a high limit, right?"

Hey all,

I'm 20 and looking to get another credit card after having my Discover for almost a year.  Planning to apply for the CF in October(so &gt;1 of credit history), but I'm not sure how to list my income.  The work I currently have isn't consistent, currently I'm expecting to make ~$60,000 overall this year, but if I apply in October, the two or three most recent paystubs would make it look like my annual income should be closer to $100,000(i.e. $4,000 biweekly).  Will this be a red flag to Chase if my listed income is $60,000, or is it not likely to be an issue? 

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

No missed payments or anything bad like that. Minus the AMEX card since it’s not on the report yet, the only newest revolving account this year is the CSP same day. The other newest is a secure loan in January. Average account age is 20 months.

What is the best way to maintain the relationship with Chase? I can still make the CSR work financially due to the doordash and lyft credits, and I still plan to take advantage of the freedom categories. However, I'd like to avoid a shutdown with the massive drop in spend.

CreditCards,"I was charged by a merchant who ended up closing due to covid19 and was unable to render 90% of the services I paid for. I went to them first and when they refused to return the partial charge I filed a chargeback with capital one for services not given. After a month they decided against me because the merchant provider a terms sheet stating no refunds under any circumstances. I figured since a refund implies something was actually exchanged (eg services) that that was an inappropriate use of that word since I hadn't received anything in exchange for my money. Capital one disagreed and closed the dispute.

I went through bbb and got a nonsensical letter from capital one stating that I needed to provide more evidence (???). I went through cfpb and got the exact same response. I have given up at this point and closed my account with them but am wondering who regulates Capital one and what recourse one would have aside from court if they fail to hold up their end of the credit card as they did in this case."
CreditCards,"**Current Business Card**: Chase Ink Preferred (CIP) opened on 11/2019 — closing in on their $150,000 annual spending limit for 3X points. Afterwards, all expenses will only receive 1X points.

I see it’s possible to open up a second CIP, but would this be something that I can do and still receive 3X points on or would Chase see that I have already reached the 3X point limit on my first CIP? I’m also not sure I’d get a second sign on bonus since I received it less than a year ago. A lot of the info floating around online seems outdated now.

Alternatively, I was also considering an AMEX Business Gold, which would provide 4X points with an annual fee of $295 and a sign on bonus of 35,000 points.

My annual business spend is anywhere from $180,000 - $225,000 so the second card would only be handling $30,000-75,000.

Having all of my point be Chase points would be nice for the sake of consolidation, but understandably this might not be possible.

CreditCards,"Hello,

I have a strange occurrence this month. I have a credit card that I use basically only for Costco and occasionally Albertson's (grocery stores for this unfamiliar). Anyway, three weeks ago I got about $200 in Apple charges on my card. I called up my credit card and disputed the charges. Everything went fine and a new card was issued.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I got the new card, I have been to Costco twice and had a total of two new purchases. Three days ago, I received an email that an attempt to charge my OLD card was made (to Spotify) and did not think much of it (previous thieves using the old credit number which they didn't know was cancelled). Today, I checked my card and saw a charge by Spotify. I ended up having to get the new card cancelled too and another card issued.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really confused, how could this happen? I ran anti-virus software on my computers and didn't find anything (which doesn't matter because I never used the new card online). Any theories? Like I said, the new card was only used twice in real life. No one has access to my credit card other than me and I have never used Spotify."

CreditCards,"Hey guys, I just ran into this issue with Chase and was curious if anyone else had a similar issue and how you handled it. 
  
Back in February when my card was up for renewal, I product changed my Sapphire Preferred into a Sapphire Reserve, and when I did so I sent a secured message to Chase asking whether I'd qualify for the old annual fee or if I'd be charged the new annual fee. I was told because I was product changing an existing account and not opening a new account, I would be assessed the old annual fee. Well, Chase waited until June to charge me the annual fee, so it's no surprise that it came in at $550. That's no problem, I told myself, since Chase was offering $100 credits to Reserve cardholders due to the pandemic. Since it has been almost three months since I was charged the annual fee, I sent Chase another secured message today to ask when I should expect to see the credit come through, and was told I was ineligible for the credit because I ""product changed before the renewal date."" It sounds like Chase is using June as the renewal date for my account instead of February when I product changed to the new card. Am I wrong in thinking I should be eligible for the credit?"

I have never had a late payment although I did carry a balance on two of those cards for a while because of certain circumstances but as of now I have paid off all my credit cards in full. Another thing is I rarely use the cards. So my question is does lack of movement and almost never charging anything to the account affect my chances of getting an increase and also did caring a balance for a few months affect my chances?

CreditCards,"Just wanting to make sure that this is correct.

Can't remember where I saw this from, most likely a video on YouTube, but I heard that one way to avoid getting hard inquires on your report when you apply for credit cards is to get into ""public record"". And then once you start getting offers and on the application if they only ask you for the last 4 digits of your social security number instead of your full social, then it will only be a soft pull and not a hard pull.

Is this true? If so, what companies does this really apply to?"
CreditCards,"Wanted to share my experience in attempts to get the annual fee waived on Capital One Venture. I have had it for a year and the annual fee will be charged next month. Since I am no longer traveling or dining out as much during pandemic, I was hoping to get the $95 waived or downgrade the card. 

The rep said they did not have ""any offers to waive the fee on my account"", but welcome to downgrade my card. I was honestly a bit surprised as I've heard they're pretty generous w/ waiving the AF. I instead downgraded to the Venture One card with the card number and credit limit remaining the same, but instead of 2x points, it's 1.25x. She did say if the AF had posted, they would not be able to reverse or credit the fee after it posts. 

Hope you have better luck than me w/ them waiving the fee. I'm on the hunt for the next card now!"

CreditCards,"Hi all,
New to the credit card game and qualified for an Apple card (looking to upgrade my phone in the future). 

I've been reading around and the basic rule I've seen is to always pay in full versus installments.

Since the apple card has 0% APR for apple products, I was thinking about buying a new phone on a monthly plan so that I can build my credit without going over a 30% utilization, I also don't really plan to use the apple card for anything else (looking for a better card for Cash-back).

Do you guys think this is a good idea? Or are there any drawbacks I'm missing?"

New info:
After noticing that Chase referrals now had the 5% groceries in the referral link I decided to try again. I sent another secured message last night and they replied that they will add it to my card within 2 weeks. So if you tried to add it before and were denied, try again now."

CreditCards,"Hi all, I’m wondering what you think the rewards card I can get would be?

I have a Ch7 from Spring 2014. Burned the following:
* Barclays x2
* Amex x2
* Citibank
* Capital One

Since then, I’ve had no bad marks at all and 3 inquiries reporting. I have no balances and the following credit lines:
* Amazon Store: $6,000
* Dell Store: $4,500
* Best Buy Citi: $5,500
* Discover: $2,400
* Kohl’s: $3,000
* Apple Card: $6,000
* Capital One: $1,500

FICO Ex is 670 and I have a new $300k mortgage that’s going to start reporting in a few weeks, likely dropping my score. When I applied for my mortgage the company showed I had scores around 730-740 but it’s unclear what system they were using (Better.com).

My understanding is that Chase will decline until the BK is off, even though I didn’t burn them. AMEX will never approve, ever. And Citibank will also decline even though I have a store card.

Are there any premium cards I’d have a shot at? I have a $165k income."

Thanks for incentivizing me to dump the card, move all that spending to another card and never pay you an annual fee again.

# Capital One cuts credit limits as millions struggle with income cliff

""...But the move isn't going over with Capital One customers, with many  voicing complaints on social media about the decision. ""Long time  customer, both savings, checking, and credit card,"" one person wrote.  ""Many years using my card for international travel ... Decided to reduce  my line of credit by more than 1/2. GUESS LOYALTY MEANS NOTHING!""  
... A reduced credit card limit can have a very real effect on consumers by  affecting their credit score. That's because credit scores are partially  based on the amount of credit that a consumer is using, with a lower  ""utilization rate"" resulting in a higher score. For instance, a consumer  with $10,000 credit limit and a $3,000 balance on their card has a 30%  utilization rate. But if their credit limit is halved to $5,000, their  utilization rate jumps to 60%, which could reduce their credit score."""

I've been spending my card in a wide variety of places recently which has been causing it to be declined due to suspected fraud. All spending is legitimate, but triggering the automated flags by my bank. Their customer service is sub-par and frequently leaving me in terrible situations. I need a new card, either as primary, or backup to overcome this issue."
CreditCards,"Hi!

So I applied this morning for the CSP. I have a 740 FICO score, no late payments or anything like that and one BoA card open (opened a year and a half ago) with an $8k limit, and my income is $190k (just graduated from law school hence only a year history). I was not instantly approved and received an email stating ""We have received your request for a Chase credit card. We'll let you know our decision as soon as possible.""

After reading some things on this forum, I decided it would not hurt to just call recon anyway. I called and they said it needed to go through verification. I spoke to someone in verification who told me it was not them but lending needed to approve. Just slightly confused where the hold up is? I did have relatively high utilization last month but I just paid it down and BoA has recently increased my credit limit.

Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on what to make of this! Thanks!! I literally spend all my money on dining and travel so really wanted to upgrade!

Edit: I just called the application status line, earlier it was saying 30 days, but now it says approved for a $16,500 limit! Thanks for all the help everyone :) "

I was planning to use it to pay my houses utility bills as it would build my credit and I would get at least some cash back. However, the electricity bill is around $350 which is obviously above the 30% credit utilization limit rule.

CreditCards,"As the title says; I got preapproved for the card and they offer 5% cash back on groceries excluding Target and Walmart (which I never go to anyway).

The main reason I need a new card is that discover is not as widely accepted, and I buy things from international merchants. so I would need a card without a foreign transaction fee. In the future I would also like to travel more. or If I needed to get two cards to fulfill that role, that would be fine too.

CreditCards,"Was an online training. I will not be asking for a certificate of completion. I have another better quality training that I want to take instead.

The issue was that there was no refunds listed in the terms and conditions, but that information was not listed anywhere on the website. When I opened up the class it was low-quality, including audio and visual production issues. I asked for a refund and was told no, the merchant cited that no refunds was listed in the terms and conditions I agree to when paying.

 then I took it to a credit card dispute where the agent told me that since the no refunds was in the terms and conditions, it was not likely I would be able to win the dispute. Then I decided to give up and just do the class even though it would be begrudgingly, and I notified the owner of the business who made the training and I had requested to cancel the dispute and I sent her a forward an email from the credit card company stating this.

A Couple days ago (after about almost 60 days of initiating the dispute) I got an email saying my dispute was closed and I won it, and at the credit that they made to my account right away would now be permanent. honestly I'm pretty happy because I still have a low opinion of the training.

I know for a fact that thousands of people have signed up for this so I'm not even sure that the owner / merchant will even notice anything is different.

Wondering if anyone has experience with this. I would like to move on with my life and just take my other training, but curious if the merchant might be able to dispute it from here or take other action? I'm aware that merchants are able to sue or send to collections, she probably won't Sue because of the low cost of the course - it's in the 300s, but maybe collections. Which I wouldn't be scandalized over.

Thanks for your time! Not trying to take advantage of the merchant honestly I don't even want to look at the course because of its quality. So just wanted to check in on peoples experiences and awareness of this.. take care everyone."
CreditCards,"Hi All,

Just wanted to share a story about downgrading my capital one venture rewards. I had the card for over a year and saw the fee hit my statement. I called in to downgrade and they offered to waive the fee to keep the card one more year. I still decided to downgrade (I don't use the card at all, just wanted the SUB). I downgraded to the ventureOne rewards card with no AF.

I just called in and the process was very easy. Didn't have to be the AF at all and the new card is in the mail today.

Wanted to share my story because I am new to downgrades (this is my second time doing it) and thought others may be interested in cards for the SUB but are unsure of their options for downgrade paths.

Happy to answer anything and have a great day :)"

CreditCards,"So my place recently started offering the ability to put rent on a credit card with no fees. 

I figured that’s great, I’ll put it on my credit card to get some points.

So my American Express has a $2,000 limit and my rent is about $1,700. 

Since I only have a few charges per month that are nowhere near that amount, would they flag this as suspicious if suddenly a $1,700 charge comes through? 

Should I call and let them know so they don’t flag it? 

Or just try it and see what happens?

* Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card? I have an mco debit card that I get 3% back with that I use for general spending planning to upgrade it to the 4% back eventually.

Main thing here is I am trying to figure out if I can get applied for a chase card, I have had my Amex for 8 months and my score is at its highest it has been. I am worried about the income part because of my lack of work, Including unemployment I have made around 17,000 so far this year. I am living with my parents which is why my spend is so low, and I am a student."
CreditCards,"Are banks actively reducing credit card limits now to mitigate their lending liability? I just had three different banks reduce my credit limit: American Express, Barclays, and Capital One.

As they reduce the credit line, you're credit score gets worse, utilization goes up, and then it's a chain reaction where other banks reduce your CL too and becomes a vicious cycle raising your utilization percentage."
CreditCards,"Wondering if it's a good idea to apply for a CSP right now. I'm 2/24 and a college student. I won't be graduating until about 2 more years so I was wondering if I should get a CSP for the welcome bonus, then downgrade it to a CF. Then, after the 48 month period I want to apply for a sapphire card since right now I don't plan on doing any traveling since I'm a college student and won't be having that much spending.  


Would this be a good idea? And if I ever wanted to have a CSR/CSP early on before the new sapphire member eligibility is available, I could always just upgrade my CF back to a CSR/CSP right? I also currently have CF and CFU."
CreditCards,"Once travel opens back up a bit more, I anticipate that I will finally have crossed the threshold to making the Chase Sapphire Reserve worth the additional annual fee over my current Chase Sapphire Preferred, therefore I’m interested in upgrading. I live halfway across the country from my family, so I fly to visit at least twice a year for holidays (still planning to this year as well), and would like to make that 3X/year plus an annual personal vacation as soon as Covid winds down.

I have just been approved for the Citi AAdvantage card which I plan to use exclusively for the next 3 months to get the sign up bonus, after which I will likely cancel it before the annual fee hits.

After getting the AAdvantage SUB, I will go back to using my Chase cards for the travel points, and would like to take advantage of the fact that my CSP is over 4 years old now to get the CSR SUB. Here is my plan:

1. Downgrade CSP to Freedom Unlimited now, before my $95 annual fee hits in September
2. Get AAdvantage SUB by using it for 3 months
3. Switch to using CFU for general spending
4. Use up AAdvantage SUB
5. Hopefully Covid slows down
6. Apply for CSR prior to next travel
7. Use $300 travel credit immediately upon approval
8. Cancel AAdvantage before annual fee hits
9. Keep using CFU for general spending and using CSR to redeem points/book travel

Does that process sound reasonable? Thanks!

CreditCards,"Today, 2020-08-27, I was instantly approved for the Amex BCE with a $2,000 credit limit, and the highest APR (20.74%). No prior relationship with Amex. I had a prequalified offer from the portal with no fixed APR.

Stats at the time of the application:

* 1 card: TD Cash, 12 months old, CL $650, 0% utilization.

I also have a Chase Freedom, &lt;1 month old, CL $1,300, but I don't think it was on the report they pulled.

* Experian: FICO 8: 731. 4 hard inquiries; 3 at least 12 months old, 1 less than a week old. No derogatory marks.

* Income: $17,000 all taxable.

Seems that they only pulled Experian, based on the form where they list my score they used. Considering the Chase card probably wasn't even on it, this is certainly an example of Amex being very generous with their credit limits, surprisingly even now (but of course does not indicate that they always will be).

Very pleased with my credit card situation now, I will be set for quite a while. Thanks for all the help here!"

CreditCards,"I’ve had the Chase Sapphire Preferred since the beginning of the year and today received an email from Chase marketing the new CFU promotion of the $200 sign up bonus and 5% on groceries for the first year.

CreditCards,"So over the past 8 months, I have managed to get my Experian Fico 8, from 596 to 736. After the debacle of 2008, and defaulting on everything in the few years after, my FIRST NEW CARD started reporting in JAN 2020.

NO BKs, NO public stuff, and 1 collection (removed). Done everything I can with aggressive challenging of old negatives, and extremely good behavior with new cards. Everything paid on time, no interest-incurring monthly balances left, and &lt;10% utilization by statement time.

However, I noticed that in the past 3-4 months, the score has floated in the 720's/730's..... so now I am wondering if the trajectory starts to slow and dip and go snakelike, with little ups and downs.

The 140 points/8 months has surprised and impressed me, BUT it seems that things slow way down when you get to the 720's-750's area.

They say that Age of Accounts makes up only 10-15% of scoring models, but I cannot help but be suspicious that it becomes more important than that, the closer you get to 800 (and it's the one thing that no one can manipulate). I have an old paid-in-full mortgage and p.i.f. car loan that still show. Otherwise, everything is 2020 fresh.

**So the question (somewhat arbitrary and guessing): will this take another 8 months to get only 30 points higher (say 760/770), and another 8 months or 1 year after that, to hope for another 30 points, to 800 ??**"
CreditCards,"Basically I was transferring money in between my accounts and I was supposed to transfer $1000+ from my chequing account to my savings account. Ended up transferring to my credit card and ""overpaying"" it. 

Should I transfer money back or will purchases with the credit card be ""paid back"" immediately and therefore impact my credit score positively?"
CreditCards,"Hi all, 

I have a question about the Citi Double Cash. 

I know it’s one of the best cash back cards out there. However one of the reasons I’ve avoided using it is because you need a minimum of $25 in rewards to redeem. I’ve always shied away since I prefer flexibility and have low spend to begin with. 

So my question is once you hit $25, can you redeem any amount, or does it need to be in increments of $25? 

I guess another question I have is about redeeming it for cash back. If I have a chase account can I withdraw to my bank? Or do I need an account with Citi to do that? 

Thanks!"

My question is how to fill out this application seeing that I’m in a temporary position at the moment. I just graduated from grad school and I’m not making much money at the moment. However, I have a salaried job starting in January. Should I apply as a student or employed? 

Should I use this years income on average for the year, my income right now (which is really low) or my larger salary which will start in January? 

I am just looking to build credit at the moment but I feel like I won’t get approved with my current income. 

Thanks in advance!"
CreditCards,"My girlfriend recently got a credit card in the month of July that was promoted for helping to rebuild credit. Yesterday, as we were discussing credit cards and building our credit score, I had told her Graham Stephan recommended opening a new no annual fee credit card every 8-12 months. She then realized that the credit card she signed up for had a high annual fee of $75.

The card is Credit One Bank's Platinum Visa for Rebuilding Credit. I think it would be less costly and more effective for her to start tacking on more no annual fee credit cards. But we're not quite sure what to do with this annual fee credit card. The benefits don't seem to be that great. I read that you normally don't want to close any credit cards, but this is costing her $75 she could be saving every year.

I recommended she opens a no annual fee Discover It Student Chrome card while she's still in school. The problem is she had just opened up this annual fee card just last month. She has had 3 hard inquiries in the past 2 years according to [mint.com](https://mint.com). And her credit score is within the 600-650 range. We're worried that this ding to her credit might be for naught if she doesn't get accepted for this student card. I would assume creditors are more likely to be forgiving toward students (please correct me if I'm wrong). But then again, Graham Stephen said that Hard Inquiries only account for 10% of your credit score.

She said she is planning to pay off her balance in full this Friday. We decided since she already paid the annual fee for this year, to keep the card for one year, and then right before she has to pay the annual fee, call up Credit One and attempt to negotiate waiving the annual fee, and if they won't do it, then to finally just close the card.

1. Should she apply for the student card ASAP? In a few months? Or if there is any other cards you guys recommend, that would be amazing!
2. Should she close the annual fee card or just put up with the $75 if she can't get the annual fee waived?
3. Is any of the advice I've given her or assumptions I made wrong or risky? Let me know, so I can tell her.

Thanks again for making it this far!"

CreditCards,"Hi, I have spent 16 years building excellent credit (around 785) and then a combination of over-investing in a house flip, tax increases, and the covid related salary cuts have stacked with all the banks slashing credit lines, and so I've been hacked do to 625 and I am not sure how best to consolidate the credit cards and keep the ship upright for 9-12 months.

I am a federal employee with an automatic promotion in 9 months as well as orders to transfer in 1 year so not only will my salary increase 20%, I am most definitely down-sizing within that time frame. However, I have reached around 66k usage on about 150k worth of credit cards, mainly to improve the home resale value.

CreditCards,"EDIT: I went with the Discover It card. I figured I'd rather have a card I can have for life and worst case I just use cash. Thanks for the advice!

So I'm a senior and I have yet to get a credit card. I'm looking at student cards because I have no credit history, and so far I've been rejected from the Capital One Journey card because of insufficient income ($6k, which I thought would be okay). Anyways, I know Discover is far and away the most popular starter card and I really wanted to go with it, but there's a chance I study abroad next semester (assuming a vaccine comes and the UK lets me in). I know Discover is basically not viable overseas unless you have a backup card, and my dad is concerned about that.

My question then is, should I go with a secured card? Capital One has one but I've heard they sometimes don't upgrade you to an un-secured card and I don't want to cancel a card for that security deposit and affect my credit score.

That seems to be my best option from a company that has a functional app and is generally trustworthy. Otherwise, is there a way to go with a discover card and still be in a good position overseas?

So I've been working on building up my credit since I turned 18 and my first step was opening a card with BoA. I've had the BoA Cash Rewards Card since early February ($300 limit since I opened it secured at first) and according to Boa/TransUnion I'm currently at a 740. One of the things the TransUnion report mentions as bringing down my score is the length of the accounts I have open and a lack of different sources of credit. Other than my BoA card all I have is a Federal Govt. Student Loan for $5,000. I was wondering if due to this it would be worth opening a second card, and if so if anyone has any recommendations. I'm generally really responsible with my card: never using the whole line, paying it off in full monthly, etc. - the basics. 

Thanks so much for reading!"

Hi folks been reading this site for a few weeks - first time post. Tons of great stuff on here. 

I wanted to get into the no AF game and start the Chase trifecta and start with the UR game. I applied for the CFU this morning and was denied. I called Chase Recon and spent almost 30 minutes on the phone but got the new card approved. I was nervous since I had opened two new cards this year and wanted to get into Chase w/ 5/24 approaching. 

Thanks for all the suggestions to call for reconsideration. I verified with the customer service specialist my recent credit hard pulls (I recently moved) and my income/current rent payment. 

One interesting item to note that I didn't see mentioned earlier is the customer service specialist asked me if I would move credit around since my MPE card had $19,000 but highest I had every gone on it was about $6,000. I said yes and lowered that amount to get CFU at a $5,000 limit."

It's coming up on six months since my last application and...the world has changed a lot. All my Delta trips got canceled in the spring and I'm left holding my lovely new Delta Gold card, a bucket of SkyMiles and Delta eCredit...and exactly zero travel plans. Whoops.

I think cash rewards, customer-focused service, and simplicity are probably my goals now. The Altitude Go is appealing because it consolidates the vast majority of my spending on a single card, plus has no foreign transation fees (althoug the Amazon card and Delta both have this). A little concerned about my February inquiry in regards to applying, but I have a long-standing and good relationship with the bank as my primary bank, so I hope they'd be nice to me. \^\_\^

That being said, the Altitude Go's benefits are largely replicated with my existing card setup, so it's not like I need it. The signup bonus is nice, but not enormous. Chase and Amex have good customer service. Would deepening a relationship with them now benefit me in the future if I wanted stronger travel cards? Hard to make plans when you have no idea what the world would look like. I have no issues with annual fees, but I'm not ready for fancy travel cards right now.

A little wary about starting up with a new issuer, but I'm open to suggestions. I'd love some input from you knowledgable people. Otherwise, I am fine sitting in a holding pattern for a bit. ""Gardening"" as the term goes. Thanks! :)"

CreditCards,"Hello everyone,

A concert I have purchased tickets for has been postponed indefinitely. The total is about $400. I used my credit card to purchase those tickets and have paid my card off a long time ago. 

If I am refunded, will I have a balance of -$400 on my credit card, or is it possible to get the money I paid the card off with back?"
CreditCards,"Hello everyone, 

I know that having a high utilization ratio negatively affects your credit, which is why it’s important to keep the balance on all your cards below 30% of the limit. My question is at what point does the balance on your card affect your credit? For example, I just made a $2000 purchase on a $3000 limit credit card a few hours ago. My account says no payment is due because it doesn’t generate until the 2nd of the month. However I do see the purchase I made reflected in the current balance. So if I wait until after the 2nd of next month will my credit go down because of the high utilization ratio? Or do I have until the month after next month before my credit gets affected? Thank you for any help you can provide!"

CreditCards," 

Only recently started looking into improving credit health and setting myself up for the long term. I made some mistakes 4 or 5 years ago and closed a capital one/discover card with collections. I believe I also had an issue where I closed a citi DC card,so I am unsure if I'm blacklisted from Citi, but I can't find it anywhere on my credit report, so it may have dropped off by now, that being said I did get denied for a citi DC recently and may have to call to confirm.

I got the CSP because I am planning a trip and got the 60k SUB the first month. I have never had a card worth using before, but would like to start getting something back. I have 5 hard inquiries recently (auto loan, credit cards), so will likely wait 3-6 months before applying, but would like to have a plan.

CreditCards,"I have a Chase card that I had used for a balance transfer at 0% earlier in the year.  I used it for some additional purchases and then a couple of weeks later, made a payment in the amount of the total of my purchases and then on the payment due date, I made the minimum payment amount as originally scheduled.  Instead of using my payments to cover the purchases, Chase used those payments to pay down the promotional balance, and now I am being hit with $100 in interest charges on those purchases each month.  Is this legal?  I thought they were required by law  to apply payments above the minimum to higher interest balances first."

I know I can always go with an Amex or Citi card, but would like to keep my points consolidated on Chase if all possible.

CreditCards,"Hello,

I am aiming to apply for a CSP at the beginning of next year as I anticipate some payments that may help me get the 60K points bonus when spending 4000$ within 3 months.

However I have only recently started my credit record and I have a Equifax/Transunion score of 700 and I am thinking of getting the Chase Freedom because it has no annual fee and to establish a relationship with Chase that will help when the time comes for me to apply for the CSP.

However, I do not want to lose the 60K bonus offer so does anyone know if getting a freedom card affects that offer or if there's any clause that will disqualify me of that offer since I am interested in the bonus points more than just getting a new card (The freedom will just be a means to the CSP end)?

Thanks a lot for your help!

Edit: My credit history started only 3 months ago if this info is useful, thanks!"
CreditCards,"The representative said I got rejected due to low credit history and score?

I've had a Credit Card under my parents throughout undergrad and my score via credit karma is over 700, I also included them in my income as they are supporting me as I go for my medical degree so the income should have been decent as well. Not sure what happened.

I recently got an apple card (a mistake after reading more into it) to help finance the upcoming iPhone and I also applyed for the Discover it card. 

I do like to travel and my spending is going to be fairly high this year due to application costs and was hoping to go for a Chase set. 

Anyone have advice moving forward? 
What should I do in the meantime and when should I reapply?"
CreditCards,"So I managed to bump up to a new C1 Quicksilver card and I’ve been using it more because there’s an actual benefit to doing so, but when I applied to get my credit line increased they gave two reasons why they wouldn’t:

1. Not enough payment history. 
-This one I get. I got the card paid off about two years ago and never used it because with no rewards program, I had literally no reason to. I have other cards with generous rewards programs, so why not use those instead? 

Now the next confuses me. 

2. Not using the full amount.
-Can a card company deny a line increase if you’re not using close to the full amount available? My line is $750, so should I go out and use close to that, and pay that off? 

Due to the recent financial climate, I have seen that many card companies are cutting credit limits, and I get that. That said, I work two jobs that are very much “in demand” and I don’t expect to be getting laid off anytime soon."
CreditCards,"I posted a few days ago, but now i have another question and Google is not being helpful. Is it a better idea to apply for a joint or cosigner credit card rather than applying by myself? I have someone I can use, they have good credit. A little better then mine by a little. Will this help my chances? Or give me more credit or something?"
CreditCards,"Hey everyone, an answer to this would be extremely appreciated. 

So I need Capital One’s Eno (VCC Service) when I buy for my business. I have Capital One credit cards, which provide the Eno service, but the issue is I only have a $2100 limit across both cards. I typically can spend $2,000-$5,000 on a buying day, and have been unable to buy the way I want due to my credit limits. I have to use VCCs also, there is no way around that. 

So, my question is if I open a 360 Checking account with capital one, will I be able to create Eno VCCs for that account? Because if so, that could make a huge difference in the amount of profit I start bringing in. 

Thanks!"

$10,000 CREDIT CARD AT 19 YEARS OLD"
CreditCards,"Hi there, I'm seeking advice for the continued path in the journey of credit cards. Specifically looking for the next card or two to target as I've been able to spend time and research more about finances over the last few months. I applied for and got the Freedom card recently (went with it over the CFU as I knew I had some Amazon purchases to make).

Also some background: The no-brainer option would seem to be Chase Sapphire R / P, but...I've had Amex Gold for a few years and really haven't used many points (I have like 200k+ points racked up). I recall getting the Gold before the Sapphire was really seen as popular, and while both are great for no foreign transaction fees, the biggest gripe with Amex is that it's not accepted as widely around the world. The Gold is pretty much my ""catch-all"" card.

I'm not opposed to another annual fee card, but harder to justify if I am spending more than the benefits. Also I would open to getting a new card then closing within a year or two, but I don't have experience with that and not certain of what the implications might be!

In regards to the 5/24, it’s only for new accounts opened right? I was denied a few cards in 2018 but am in a much better situation financially in 2020. I do believe that there are more than 5 “checks” on my score, but since 2018, I’ve only actually OPENED up 4 accounts."
CreditCards,"Hello! After taking advice of others on this subreddit I applied for and got approved for a discover student It card. I'll be a student for one more year and hope to build credit to get a different card by then. 

Current plan: Instead of using my debit card put all my purchases on the credit card and pay it off each month.

My question is if that's the most efficient way to build credit or if I should do something else? Most likely around $300 in expenditures not counting housing payments. Should I pay rent with my credit card too? I'm not worried about not being able to pay back the credit as I have enough to pay each month. My concern is using it correctly and efficiently. Thanks!"
CreditCards,"Over the last year, I’ve gotten several credit cards a lot more then I should have. I made the mistake of carrying balances on all of them. I have a total of nine cards. Amex blue cash preferred,capital one quick silver,citi double cash,discover it, my favorite the us bank altitude go the Apple Card and three different Wells Fargo cards,propel,visa signature and college card . We have enough in saving to pay all of our balances a little over four thousand. My question is I’ve gotten so tired of juggling multiple cards and having to make so many payments to multiple cards a month . 

I would really like to close a majority of them but not sure what will happen to my credit score since I’m currently sitting at a 701. I was at a  FICO 720 two months ago but adding my us bank and my discover dropped my score a lot. 

Also my wife and I have not missed a single payment in over 84 months according to credit karma and I’ve had my amex blue cash preferred for three years and have yet to receive one limit increase, so I’m sure there first on the chopping block also there the only one with an annual fee.

Any and all advice is appreciated!!!!!"
CreditCards,"I just recently started workint on my credit. My first and current was a student cash back discover it card with a $1000 limit. I was wondering should I apply for other cards with high level of approval like capital one secured platinum card and such? The reason  why I want to apply with many cards in the start of building my credit is because I dont want my credit history to constantly average out every 6 months everytime I get a new card. I rather my credit temporary lower for 2 years with hard inquiries than have a short credit history, and a low credit utilization. I need advice should  I apply for a card every 6 months or much more frequently but not over do like."

So this Citi is the ""Rewards +"".

I have a 720 FICO score and was going to finally apply for my first credit card through my local area bank. I was curious about if you apply for a credit card through a bank you already have a checking account with, do they take into account your checking account activity as well while seeing if you qualify for a card through them? I have overdrafted on my checking account a couple of times due to covid."
CreditCards,"Basically, I owe the collections $324. If I pay it off my credit score will most likely go up. I got a letter saying they’ve given me a resolution offer of $162.50.

CreditCards,"I've moved to the US around a year and a half ago. My wife put me as an authorised user on two of her credit cards with CSP as the main one we use. We pay off both of the credit cards in full every month and we don't have any missed bills or other monthly payments.

 I travel a lot for work and I tried applying for Marriott Bonvoy Boundless since I primarily stay at their properties and they had a 100k point promotion for 3k spent. Got denied with them saying that my credit age is too short and the second reason they've put was total available credit. My listed credit score on the letter was 765.

Is worth it for me to get a starter card and put something small every month on them since I've been getting those preapproved letters from Amex and Capital One for a few of their cards or is it better for me to just wait with being authorized user on CSP that we use right now.

Not sure if the second question is for this sub or for r/awardtravel. Would we be able to get the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless through my wife, but link it to loyalty program that is under my name or does it need to be name matched with the primary user?"
CreditCards,"So I've seen lots of information online but it's not always clear and sometimes contradictory. I'm trying to understand how a closed account affects the average age of the account.

Suppose I have a credit card that is 2 years old today and I close it. In a year, does it count like a 2 year old account, or a 3 year old?   


Also, I know it changes cradit utilization ration. Are there other wais it affects my credit score.

My current credit score is 714. It has been decreasing by about 4 points every week or so, and I’m just not sure why. I haven’t made any late payments, applied for any new cards, or anything else I can think of that would lower my score.

Just confirmed with an Apple rep that this does work, you can use Apple ID balance for Apple Store,App Store, and iTunes purchases.

I tried using the other line for application status and was informed that my application was being reviewed and would take 7-10 business days to get a response. 

Does that mean I need to wait up to 10 days for the reason why I got rejected or that my application is still pending?"
CreditCards,"Seems Chase, Amex, Citi, etc have been offering temporary additional benefit perks or cashback enhancements to encourage card use during Covid. Does anyone expect Discover to follow the trend? Seems odd that they haven’t followed the rest of the market on this and have only done lower APR and the skip a payment feature."
CreditCards,Anyone noticed Chase taking longer than normal to report balances this month on Experian? Chase normally reports for me around the 18th-20th of each month on both cards (especially if there's an increase or decrease in usage). One of my cards finally hit below 9% on my payment from the 15th but nothing yet nor a change in score.

I'm a bit new to the US credit card game since I am not a resident, but I've managed to set myself up with the required steps and have an established though short history. I tried to look for information on these specific cards but very little was available. My plan on which cards I want to get differs from your average guy because of my location and my daily driver already giving me 4% cashback on everything, which is why I'm diving into the hotel cards first and intend to skip Freedom (unlimited). 

My question to you is simply, at what point do you think I should do my first application? I assume the three mentioned are of similar difficulty to get, but if not, I'd be happy to start with the easiest because they all offer similar value to me.

CreditCards,"I’m 18 and this is my first credit card, there’s some things which I want clarifying. 

Firstly, on the ‘Which?’ Website, under the heading ‘standard purchases’ it says the card has an ‘annual interest of 34.94%’, i was wondering if interest would be added to any purchases, or if they get added only if you do not pay the full sum off within the time provided (ie at the end of the month).

Secondly, there’s is a ‘maximum interest free period (purchases) of 56 days’ however it also says that I’d have ‘26 days to pay’, well, without sounding like an idiot, which is it? Does that 56 day period apply for the first 56 days of owning the card, and the 26 days is the interest free period after making a purchase (the time you have to pay it off without any added interest?"
CreditCards,"I am currently planning my wedding and decided to apply for a Discover It card to take advantage of the 0% promo they have. I was approved, but for a lower than expected credit line. I called Discover to ask if there was any way to review or increase the line, but they do not do that until the account is open for 12 months. Instead, they were able to give me a 0% promo on the existing card I have with them, which has a significantly higher line of credit. My mistake for not looking into that first, but I now no longer want this new account. 

Discover rep I spoke to 2 days ago said I can call and cancel the account before it gets reported. I called today and the rep said they report everything. 

So my question is: if I close this account immediately after opening it, will my credit be negatively impacted? Should I just keep the card open? 

TL;DR - applied and approved for new cc account, no longer need/find beneficial and want to close it. What will happen if I do?"

CreditCards,"I’m confused on how FICO scores work, I mean I have a general understanding but I’m looking up things and am very confused. A couple weeks ago I did the Experian app trial to see all my scores. My Experian score was 598, Equifax was 521 and TransUnion was 487, all FICO scores. The previous month Bank of America told me my TransUnion FICO score was 507. Last week a secured card I got in June/July finally showed up on the reports and my Experian FICO score jumped up to 631. Just out of curiosity I signed up for the $39.99/month level of myFICO and was surprised to see my scores (Ex 631, Eq 624, Tr 609) weren’t as far apart as the Experian app told me a few weeks ago.

So my question is: How could the older numbers be so far apart? 

How could they have jumped so much in a few weeks by having a single card show up on the reports? 

Is it possible that one of the reports was off? 

I don’t see how that last one could be true but I can’t see how a score could jump from 122 points by adding a single card.

Thoughts from the group??"
CreditCards,I heard Amex does 3x cli if you get approved after 61 days. Do they grant this if you’ve just been good paying your balance off every period? Or do they look at specific utilization rate? I heard some places like Cap One doesnt like to do CLI if you havent been using the card heavily. Is that true for Amex too?
CreditCards,"Currently in my business class and he said ""who has a credit card"" and I raised my hand and he goes ""cut it up"" you're not responsible enough.

CreditCards,I just called USAA and spoke with a lovely rep who unfortunately couldn’t help me. What’s the lowest interest rate CC out there that has a transfer promo and 0% interest promo. I have excellent credit I just hate paying the interest when I could pay it off quicker. It’s about a $2000 balance.
CreditCards,"So, let’s say that I have $800 on my credit card statement, and the due date is August 31st. I make a full payment of $800 on August 20th, but make $50 in small purchases before August 31st. 

Will the next statement consider the $800? $750? Or is it something else entirely?"
CreditCards,"I’ve never opened any type of line of credit. I’m a 21 year old who keeps trying to log into apps like credit karma, credit wise and credit sesame and everytime I try to make an account it’ll always give me an error code or message saying error right at the end. I’ve only ever lived at 2 different address and I’ll always try to make the account using both or one at a time and it never works. Everything else like my ss and maiden name (I’ve never been married or changed my name just wanna make it clear I input everything correctly) is correct and idk what’s up with it. Is it because I don’t have any existing credit that I can’t make an account ? Or idk what’s up but I’d like some help or advice for why I can’t access what my credit score is for my non-existent credit 💀"
CreditCards,"I applied for CSP as my first unsecured credit card two days before and I received message saying “Thank you for your interest and we’ll let you know our decision as soon as possible”. I see hard pull on my account in few hours after my application

My credit history is just an year old and I have two secured cards for which I have kept utilization under 10%. Credit score is 740.

Since I haven’t heard from them or I do not see any credit card in my Chase account, can I assume that I didn’t get the card and might get response via post? And is it advisable to call recon line?

CreditCards,"I have some visa/master card gift cards I’d like to use up. My normal route would be to turn them into Amazon credits/gift cards. However, I now have the Amex Amazon Business Card and I obviously use that for 5% back at Amazon. So, is there any way to pay my Amex bill with these visa/MC gift cards so I can use my cc to make purchases for 5% back instead of 0% back using the gift cards to refill my Amazon balance? I thought I may be able to pay part of it with my amazon gift balance, but don’t see if that’s a possibility. Or is there a way to pay my Amex bill directly with these $20/$100 cards? It looks like you have to use a checking account to pay Amex."
CreditCards,"I’m planning on having a wedding next summer (covid regulations permitting) and was wondering what the best card strategy would be. I applied for the vanilla platinum card 7/24 and got the 100k SUB from the ring purchase.

I’m open to anything, so please let me know what you all think!"
CreditCards,"Does anyone have experience with routinely using the NFCU duo for rewards?

The More Rewards AMEX has NO ANNUAL FEE and offers 3x on Transit, Gas, Groceries, and Dining (!!)

The VISA Flagship is 3x Travel and 2x everything else with an annual free of $49. 

Do any of you with these cards use them as daily drivers, or do you still opt for the Chase, Amex, and other brand of cards?"
CreditCards,"My initial plan was to keep saving my points and utilize them for travel, however, with COVID and the new ""pay yourself back incentive,"" it seems as though the 1.5 cents per point is roughly equal to what Id be getting through the Chase travel portal (give or take). So...

I plan to (spread out over a couple days if there is a daily spend limit) go to Home Depot and buy $15,000 worth of Amazon/Home Depot gift cards then use the 1,000,000 points to pay myself back. I already asked Chase and they said I can do this.

My question for anyone else who has done something like this with their points is would there be a better way to maximize point value (i.e. store gift card incentives, etc,) to buy gift cards? Also, I know chase had a 5x per point spend at grocery stores recently which is now no longer an option. With a $15000 purchase, that would have been an extra 750 dollars as opposed to the 150 I will get if I make my move today (at 1x per point).

Thanks in advance. I just want to be sure I'm spending this large amount of points the best way I can.

&amp;#x200B;

\[EDIT\]

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the suggestions/comments thus far.

To clarify, I do have the CSR card.

&amp;#x200B;

When I saw Chase's offer to ""pay yourself back"" at 1.5 cents per point, I thought that would almost effectively be as good as using the points through the travel portal. In that case, I could see way more opportunities to spend the money than on travel. As long as I'm getting equal value which some have pointed out I would not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this wasn't meant to be a post about earning points with gift card spend, but more about using the points I already have to cover the gift card purchase. Obviously, there would be an ancillary benefit of earning extra points with my 15k spend but that is secondary to what I am trying to accomplish.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

\[EDIT 2\]

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like many have pointed out that there is still way more value (if I spend the time) transferring the points to travel partners. I think that will be what I end up doing. The 1.5 cent ""pay yourself back"" offer right now did seem tempting as a way to quickly cash out (effectively earning 2.25% on my credit card purchases thus far) and not lose out on the 50 percent savings.

CreditCards,"Hi folks,

I'm confused on why I get 4.71% cashback on this transaction.

I have Plat Honors status, and BofA cashback set for online shopping for 3% back.


There's this transaction: 
```
$2687.04
Merchant Description: REAL ESTATE AGENTS AND MANAGER--RENTALS
Online Purchase: Y
Transaction Category: Home &amp; Utilities: Home Improvement
```

The cashback that I'm getting from that transaction is:
```
Amount $126.61

Rewards Base $26.87
Category Bonus $45.48
Relationship Bonus $54.26
```

Cashback percentage calculation
```
126.61 / 2687.04 * 100 = 4.711%
```

With Plat Honors, the only cashback percentage that you could get would be 5.25%, 3.5%, and 1.75%.

Anyone know why this one is 4.71% ?

The category bonus is at a weird 1.69% instead of 1% or 2%."

CreditCards,"TL;DR:
In the beginning stage of credit card game. Have big tuition spending coming up for the next 2 years and with fomo would like to know which card/strategy to apply. 

I'll soon become a student with a huge tuition payment and I would like to know which credit cards I should go for to not waste that tuition payment opportunity and hit the minimum spend in one go? I will be making partial payments on my tuition that cost +-$15,000 per semester (international student) for 2 years or 4 semesters ($15,000 x 4= $60,000).

I currently am in the beginning stage of the credit card game, under 5/24 rule, and have CSP, and AMEX Gold, and BoA travel rewards and cashback. (approved for Chase Freedom) 

I would be interested to start a hotel card (for anniversary night) if applicable, saw AskShebby's video and was interested to see how everyone else thinks.

Thanks for all your feedback in advance!"
CreditCards,I just received an email this morning stating they reduced my limit due to only using a portion every month. I called but customer service is completely useless as they have no power over credit limit. Has this occurred with anyone else? I spent over a year requesting an increase in credit and finally got it a little over a year ago but now back to square one. I'm pissed.
CreditCards,"Tl;dr have a gold card, bank offered me a black card recently and I took it, now planning to cancel the gold card to keep only 1. Will it screw my credit score? 

Almost exactly a year ago, I got into a new company. They opened an account for me in Scotiabank. The company has a Scotiabank account executive assigned to it and he offered me the option to get one of their Gold cards at no additional cost, and with 1 year of refundable annual fee.
I took the offer and got the card. I used it regularly and I have never missed a payment. Always keep it on 0 before the deadline.

Now, last week I got a call from the bank telling me that due to my excellent score, they wanted to offer me a MasterCard Black Card, again with 1 year free of annual fee.
I checked the benefits and they were much better than those from the Gold Card. I accepted the offer and got the black card.
I asked the bank rep if I could cancel the gold card now That I have the black card and he told me ""well...due to personal ethics I can tell you that you *can*, but that's not the idea. The bank offers you these new cards in hopes you have more products with us.""

That kind of worried me. I haven't yet taken advantage of the refundable annual fee on the gold card, and I'm even planning on emigrating within a year, so I'll probably won't even keep the black card for a year because I'll just close my account.

In other words, I would most likely not be paying the annual fee for either of the cards. That does give me the impression that it would ruin my credit but I'm not sure? Like I said I've never had a single late fee and always pay all my purchases almost immediately after buying them. The cards would be at 0 upon cancelation.

I just don't see a point in keeping the clearly inferior gold card if I already have the black card...so just wanted to know, would it screw me up to cancel it?"
CreditCards,"I had a Wells Fargo card for about 10 years and never saw any sort of email offers and still haven’t (their portal deals aren’t too great either). It was news to me when got my second card last year, the usbank cash+ card, and sent me these offers very couple of months so far. 

I wanted to know if there were any additional credit card or companies that also sent out these types of offers or incentives frequently that’s worth looking into to add to my line up."
CreditCards,"Hello everyone, I've been a credit card user since 2016 and I've always paid my credit cards in full once the statement becomes available. 

However, I've added two new cards to my wallet and this makes two other cards quite pointless. I do have subscriptions that get billed to those (now) unused credit cards. I want to be able to setup auto pay on these credit cards to ensure that all my payments are made on time.

One dumb question I may have is that if I end up paying off my credit card's previous month's statement before the ""automatic payment date,"" will autopay still trigger?

Let's say on September 1st, I get my August statement for $100. If on September 2, I go and pay off the $100 balance in full. Will autopay get trigger on September 28th (or whatever the due date would be) and it'll take another $100 out of my checking account?"
CreditCards,I am looking to pay my annual health insurance premier. It's at $2161 which 61 dollars over my credit limit. It's a discover it card. Any idea if discover will slap me with an over the limit fee or even allow the purchase to go through? I won't cost me any extra fee to use credit card and I really want those 40$ of cash back ($20 now and $20 in 3 billing cycles from cashback match)
CreditCards,"Hi all,

I'm wondering, assuming that I need to transfer 150K from MR to partners, what are the superior transfer partners for US domestic travel, that ALSO get you a more or less guaranteed seat in Economy Plus / Comfort+ (more legroom, perhaps some perks).  I have Amex Plat, if that helps.

I'm keeping in mind that travel is sort of dead right now and that the booking sweet spots have changed (4 weeks out seems good, 8 weeks out seems overpriced).

I know that Singapore and British Airways is good for booking some rewards like US West to Hawaii for \~12-15K points one way, etc, on domestic US flights with US carriers.  I have not been able to easily see/book travel, or see available seating charts -- I don't have have enough points right now to get as far as seating charts, but I **haven't seen any** **Econ. Plus** options at all on BA, Singapore or Virgin, for let's say LA to NYC, or LA to Hawaii -- only regular econ. seats.  Are you supposed to book directly through their sites?

Another decent looking option is Delta.  And their website lets you see all of their Comfort+ bookings, and sometimes for great value!

What about immediate or other similarly guaranteed options?  Such as the use of the $200 Plat credit or otherwise cheap upgrade to Econ. Plus?  (Need the leg/knee room :).  Perhaps immediately logging in after the purchase of a regular econ seat and getting an upgrade.  How would I know if it's available?

I'm hoping to avoid ""let's hope"" scenarios like trying to upgrade in the last 24 hours before the flight (although if the circumstances are that last 24h upgrades are almost guaranteed for some reason, I would love to hear about that too.)

Any thoughts on good partners?  Thanks!"
CreditCards,"Hello!

I'm currently above 5/24, but set to fall to 4/24 tomorrow. I was wondering if there's a set rule for how long I should wait before applying for a chase card after I fall below? Thanks!"
CreditCards,I want to apply for my first credit card but I don’t have any credit history and a job to provide a steady income but I heard that Discover has a reputation for approving students who don’t have a credit history but maybe it was because they had a job? I just wanted to ask how likely is it for Discover to approve me for their student card without any job or credit history? fyi: my Dad would be paying for my credit card and discover has an option to put another person’s income that would be regularly deposited into my account
CreditCards,"Wondering bc I was wanting to get one. I've read that chase does but haven't seen anything concerning this in NFCU. If any of you have had one done successfully, I'd be interested in which cards. Thanks!"
CreditCards,"Saw the offer that’s going on right now and it tempted me into applying for Chase Freedom Unlimited. I looked into getting a 2nd credit card earlier this year but didn’t apply to any as I didn’t have much credit history  and  it was only a few months after getting my 1st card. After looking on reddit, I was scared to apply only to be denied because of my low income and limited credit history. I bit the bullet and applied through the chase app and was instantly approved. It’s a low limit but I’m not spending too much and just starting to build my credit so this is great for me!

I will be using CFU for 1.5% all purchase and 5% groceries for the next year. Yay! I can use this card at Costco now. I will continue using BofA for the 3% cash back on the online shopping category. Like I said, I don’t spend too much which is why I didn’t apply for chase freedom because I don’t see myself utilizing the 5% quarterly categories. 

Here are my stats:

Chase freedom unlimited: approved for $3200 limit
Credit score: 736 chase app, 717 (FICO form BofA app)
Chase checking account since Dec 2019

Current card:
Bank of America cash rewards: $2200 limit, opened August 2019. Originally $1500 but asked for increase back in Feb

Income: $17,000 (projected for this year, student working side jobs)
Oldest account: 4 years 11 months (from student loans?)
Student loan debt: $14,500"
CreditCards,"Can I apply for two chase cards on the same day to go above 5/24? 


Also, if I am removed as an AU on a card, does that account disappear immediately from my credit report?"
CreditCards,"I am getting groceries from Instacart, do I still qualify for the 5% or does it only count for 1.5%?"
CreditCards,"I have 7 months of credit history my credit scores is 730 experian 755 equifax and 738 transunion.

currently i have the boa cash rewards which i recently graduated from secured to unsecured with a $1000 credit limit set to 3% dining

a month ago i applied for the amex cash magnet with $2000 credit limit 1.5% cash back on all purchases

my spending is mostly dining/takeout every day and online purchases(game loot)

and every now and then things from the mall like clothing and target/walmart

what should my next card be?
 i was thinking either the chase sapphire preferred since i want to get into the chase system, or the american express gold card since i eat out everyday, or the boa premium rewards for everyday spending. 

i want a card with a high limit then my current cards incase i need to make a big purchase"
CreditCards,"“You're almost done. Thank you for your application. Your reference number is xxxxxxxxxxxxx
We just need a few more minutes of your time.”

I just called the number after applying 6 hours ago and was told by the agent that they are waiting for the credit report and that I will hear back on the decision by 7 AM tomorrow via email.
Did I get denied? I was assuming they’d ask for some income verification or ID when calling but was just told that right away. If anyone has experience with Discover and this situation that’d be very helpful! Thanks"
CreditCards,"Hello, using an alternate account as I don't want these details tied to my normal account.

I own a small business and we put on average around $60,000/month on our CapitalOne Spark Business card (2% travel points). I also spend around $4,000/month on my personal CapitalOne Venture card (2% travel points). So in total I am earning \~128,000 points/month

I combine these points and use them for travel/Ubers/etc but at the rate I accumulate them I still have around 1.8 Million Points in my account and growing.

I just received notice that the Spark card is being converted from Visa to Mastercard here soon. And while I'm sure that I wouldn't have any issues switching almost all my payments over to that new card, I'm wondering if perhaps it makes sense for me to start putting this spend on another card. I can travel off the 1.8M miles for a while and my personal Visa will still earn \~8,000/mo.

So I'm wondering if anyone here has any suggestions about other credit cards that exist out there for relatively large spenders and what kind of unique benefits/rewards I could get?

\- I have avoided doing Cash-Back to this point largely because I feel that would be a more obviously taxable scenario than the travel points. Yes I am aware those are certainly still taxable.

\- I'm not a huge traveler. Maybe 3-4 trips/year. So I'm not sure more travel benefits make sense.

Yes I realize rewards cards are pretty much all about Cash-Back and Travel Rewards but I'm wondering if there isn't something else out there I could do instead. Just curious what you guys would do in my situation. Thanks!"
CreditCards,"So, I'm aware that the usual answer is no. But I have a certain credit card brand I use, and I have 2 of their credit cards. Both of which I dont want anymore. One can only be used at a certain store, and the other has a credit limit that is very low. This was fine and a big help when i was 20 years old and was trying to build my credit, but now, 8 years later, i have good credit, a house I need to pay for, etc. I need a card with a higher limit. The card that I have now is not eligible for an increase, it was a card you get when your young and has a fixed limit to help you with getting your credit score up.  I dont want to have 4 or 5 credit cards, but Id like to cancel the 2 I have in favor of one that has a larger credit. Thoughts?"
CreditCards,"I have a Chase account (checking, CD and CFU) but nothing listed in the ""Just For You"" offers.

I have a chase college checking account that I have around $1000 in there rn and I have pretty high spend on my freedom relative to the limit. My biggest concern is my 8 hard inquiries (3 show up on TU, 4 show up on equifax, but according to experian I have 8 total so maybe chase wouldn’t see them all depending on which bureau they pull but I’m in California so I think they pull from experian) 

What are my approval chances? Should I wait another month so my oldest card will be 13 months old?"
CreditCards,"   Hi, looking for some advice on whether it is worth it to attempt an app for a US Bank card, specifically the US Bank Cash+ some time around December 2020. I have most daily spending categories covered by the cards that I already hold, but the 5% back on utilities and internet is attractive, as I don't have a catch-all card at the moment. The extra gains will be at most $50 annually, but I am interested in the Altitude Reserve which requires a relationship with US Bank, and this card seems like a card that I would keep indefinitely.

I called their Application hotline to see if I could discuss it and the representative suggested that I apply for the Discover Secure card first to build up credit history. I applied for it the next day and was also denied with their reasons being ""Age of youngest Inquiry"" and lack of credit history again..

I graduated from uni last May and have been working since last September at a full time job where I make roughly 30,000 annually.  My credit Score is currently 759 according to Chase's credit journey( Experian )  I have had a Chase Slate card for about 7 years (Authorized User) and Ive been paying each month's bill in full.

I  am thinking about applying for a Chase Freedom card since I have history with them and I like the 5% cashback on rotating categories however I fear that my two hard inquiries in the last week will cause them to deny my application. Should I look at another card, Wait until the hard inquiries fade, or just apply?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

TLDR;  First real credit card. Denied for Discover it Cashback, and Discover Secure. 759 credit score. Apply again or wait?"
CreditCards,"I just talked with two Chase associates at lending services and they were able to confirm that as of August 20th, Chase has rollbacked the policy and are now again approving people whose SSN card says ""Valid for work only with DHS authorization"". I was initially denied but my application was just approved after calling the recon line."
CreditCards,"I just recently product changed from Citi Premier to Citi Rewards+ to avoid/have the annual fee refunded. The CSR would not explain to me all the changes to the ThankYou rewards redemption options from changing to one card to the other, and now that I have I can now *only* transfer points to JetBlue, at a poor conversation rate at that.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now considering reverting back to the Citi Premier while I can to transfer my points out (probably to LifeMiles?) and then PCing back to the Rewards+ or some other non-annual fee card. Is this possible? Is this advisable? Can I PC the Rewards+ back to a Premier later when we can travel again, but after this window when I can ""undo"" the PC?

Thank you!"

* What's the purpose of your next card? I'm hoping to qualify for CSP (want to work towards Chase Trifecta) in the next 3 months after our house is refinanced
* So, recently a charge off account from 2013 dropped from my credit report, resulting in my credit score shooting up 90-155 points (depending on the reporting agency). Experian shows my score as 785 now (but this is with experian boost, without it was 774).

Was really excited to up my credit card game now that I have a much better chance at being approved. Applied for CFU out the gate (should have done more homework and targeted CSP instead, but you live, you learn) and was shocked that I was denied at first. I called the recon line the next day, and that said it was due to too many inquiries, they reconsidered and ended up approving me with a CL of $2,000. This feels \*quite\* low considering annual income and credit score. 

The credit cards listed above do not include two others I applied for earlier this year and late last year and were denied (WF and BoA). Those inquiries are showing up on my credit report, along with a new auto loan and a refi HP.   

I was going to wait 90 days to apply for CSP, but it's looking less and less likely I'll get approved.

Do you all think the CL I was approved for on my CFU was due to the fact that my history looks like I might be ""credit hungry""?

Thanks in advance for any insight."

Okay so 2 simple Questions!

I have a 750 credit score on the chase app it says. I currently have the CSP, the Uber card (getting rid of it idk yet) and the Discover it card. (CSP Was 2 months ago, uber was a year ago, IT was 3 years ago) 

how long would you guys wait between getting the CSP card (2 months ago roughly) to applying for CFU or CF card???

Would you get the CFU or CF?? Sorry if it’s been asked 1000 times here already!!"
CreditCards,"I was reading my PDF statement and saw it in the fine print at the bottom. Apparently, they offered it as a MasterCard World Elite benefit for awhile. Oddly, it’s not well advertised at all.

Benefit is comparable to other cards like the WF Propel

Just thought the group would like to know.

EDIT: There are slight differences in coverage between the Mastercard and Wells Fargo plans. Mastercard offers $800 liability per claim ($50 deductible) and a max of S1,000 per year (2 claims) per cardholder. Wells Fargo offers a $600 liability per claim ($25 deductible) and a max of $1,200 per year (2 claims) per cardholder."
CreditCards,"Or can credit card companies even see if I have a secured card or not?

The reason I am asking is because I am applying for cards that I should be able to get but am being declined. I cant think of any factors that would cause me to being declined. I have no negative remarks. My utilization is sometimes around 30% and my accounts could be older. My score is 726 according to credit karma

I applied for the paypal cashback mastercard which most people say you need a score above 700 with some saying they got it with mid 600 scores."
CreditCards,"Hi,
I had a cap1 card I was irresponsible with in 2015/16 and it was charged off. $248. It’s one of the few things left on my report that’s hurting me and I want to handle it since it’s such a small amount. I called and CO said they will not delete. So my question is, do the 3 options I listed in the title have different effects on my score or is it going to continue hurting me no matter what I do?

Also, if I pleaded my case saying I was going through serious addiction issues, would CO consider PFD? Not likely but thought I’d tack on that question."
CreditCards,"I've always enjoyed the security of having text alerts when I use a card, Capital One does this well but not every bank does. FYI if you add your card to Apple Pay you will get notified for transactions, even if using the physical card. May be trivial to some but I found this to be useful.

CreditCards,"I used my CSP to book travel for a trip that was cancelled this summer, so I have a credit with the airline. I’m looking to book travel with the credit but was thinking about using the Amex Gold for the remaining fare difference.

CreditCards,"I tried to downgrade my Freedom Unlimited to a Freedom card again. but the customer service rep said I wasn’t elligible. I’ve done a total of two product changes already going from CFU to Freedom and back to CFU again.

CreditCards,"I'm 18 years old and I'm currently trying to build credit to rent myself a place and further down the road obtain an auto loan. I have zero credit history and that greatly hinders my search.

I  applied for the Discover secured card and was approved. I see the maximum deposit is $2,500. Will it have a greater positive effect on my credit if I elect to go for the maximum deposit? 

I sort of figure a $200 secured card has way less positive credit impact than a $2,500 secured card. I'm also thinking when upgrade time comes around there's a higher chance Discover will give me a greater unsecured limit, but that isn't important to me.

I may be wrong though and perhaps someone can save me the annoyance of waiting 6-8 months to get such a large deposit back. Thanks."
CreditCards,"I was just approved for the Chase Freedom Unlimited and I realized that my BofA credit card is about to start the APR (18.24%) after the one year of 0%. 

My understanding is I have to pay my balance off in full and not just the minimum right?

How do I find the balance I need to pay? Is this the line that says “last statement balance” on the app? Not the current balance right? 

And this payment would have to be before the payment due date?"
CreditCards,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading that under 30% is a good UTIL. I started recently working on my credit. I paid down my debt from 110% to 44% UTIL. I actually thought I paid it down to 22% but I didn't realize my closed credit cards with balances were counted in my UTIL on my credit report. No charge offs. I paid some loans off too.

I would like to get a home in the next six months to a year with my VA loan. I wanted to know should I make my open accounts under 10% UTIL? Or lower the UTIL on the closed CCs?  I don't know what looks good to a mortgage lender.

I get an updated myfico 3B at the end of the week to see what my new scores are. I believe I should get a big jump. My scores before paydown are.

Fico 8 | Ex - 639 | TU - 643 | Eq - 651

FICO 5, 4, 2 | Ex - 582 |TU - 591 |Eq - 590

24 open CCs. 7 of them are retail. 

9 accts have a balance with an average  28% UTIL.

2 accounts with 50% UTIL.

The rest zero balance

9 closed cards

4 with 28% UTIL

5 with 60% - 80% UTIL"
CreditCards,"I share an account with my brother on Amazon and tried to apply for a credit card with amazon. I did not know that I was applying for the amazon store card instead of the actual visa through chase.

CreditCards,"I currently have most of my debt at 0% interest due to balance transfers. All of it is timed out differently and can all be paid out when the time comes. Additional money is saved / invested. The largest sum is coming up for payment in October.

My question now comes from an offer for another 18 month offer at 0% interest (Citi diamond preferred). This sounds great because I may be able to use that amount ($7k +) to possibly make some more money, continue to save, etc.

Anyone here have experience doing something like this? I would probably end up costing the account after the offer expires since I don't really need another card with no rewards."

CreditCards,"I signed up almost one year ago for the point bonus but now my annual fee date is coming up. I heard they will keep renewals at $450 for this year instead of the $550 as originally planned. But I'm not sure if I will get to use any of the real perks of this card in the upcoming year, such as earning extra points on travel related purchases or using any airport lounges for free.

I know subtracting the $300 travel credit and Doordash $60 credit, the card is 'really' only $90. But I'm still wondering if it's worth it."

That said, I'd prefer to optimize for travel rewards with other cards and I want this as my go-to card when I don't want to be on the churn cycle. I really liked the CSP but the fee isn't really worth it to me. 

A list of things that are important are:

- No annual fee, no FTF
- Good consumer protection benefits (trip cancellation, rental insurance, etc)
- Visa or MC, no Amex/Discover

CreditCards,"[Disclaimer - I have Citi Double Cash card, not sure about any other Citi cards &amp; VANs, apologies.]

This is maybe a stupid thing to be inordinately excited about (I'm probably one of like 5 people who even cares about Virtual Account Numbers), but I've been using Citi's VANs for years now. I love them for peace of mind for trial accounts and shopping on random ecommerce sites on the internet. I've also had my CC number stolen once in the past and it was a relatively annoying headache closing the card, waiting for a new card to ship, etc. - so again, just nice knowing one-time numbers help prevent that.

Anyhow, this year's been a minor headache trying to get Citi's Virtual Account Numbers to work - their landing page which used to launch the app popup stopped working, and I had to [visit the Flash app directly](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/e3kl4i/citi_virtual_account_number_windows_app_not/flxhkn0/) as a wacky workaround. I use a Mac, not a PC, so I couldn't even try their desktop app (which reportedly also stopped working anyway).

Today I tried accessing the VAN app directly again and was continuously getting redirected to a benefits landing page. I was super sad thinking they'd finally fully discontinued VANs but when I finally tried opening the app via [the landing page](https://online.citi.com/US/ag/repcard/van/landing), to my complete shock, a brand-new non-Flash app popped up! It works the same as before (you can set $/time limits) but is an actual modern Javascript SPA now it looks like (Angular, not React - gotta love the fintech sector still being a good 5 years behind current web trends :)

Even more exciting for me personally, it actually runs in Firefox now (which discontinued Flash support a while ago) which means I no longer need to open up Chrome and manually enable Flash every time I need a virtual number. I was honestly about to start looking for another CC company to switch to that had virtual numbers but am super pleased now.

Anyway, this was a super cool discovery for me (that I'm amazed Citi hasn't made any announcements about!) and I just wanted to share."

My understanding is that if the full amount is not paid by the statement date, interest will incur on the remaining amount. Is that correct? So yesterday I paid the full amount on that card.

CreditCards,"I’ve had a Capital One Secured Card for just under 2 years (22 months) and I haven’t received a limit increase or a transfer to an unsecured card. I call all the time and inquire and they tell me I’m ineligible.

My secured card limit is $300. When I initially got the card my credit was very very bad from a delinquent student credit card I had when I was 17 that had been sent to collections and stayed there for 5+ years before I decided to do anything about it. 

My credit has slowly been building back up and my scores are (590 Equifax) and (660 TransU). I don’t qualify for any other unsecured cards and it’s driving me crazy that I can’t get my credit score up on Equifax. I’m thinking about sending in more secured funds to capital one to increase my limit and hopefully show I can handle a higher credit limit. 

Unfortunately, I have no knowledge about whether or not this will be beneficial or worth it. If I were to send in more funds to increase my credit limit, how much should I send? $200 to increase my limit to $500? $400 to increase my limit to $700? or $700 to increase my limit to $1000? Does it even matter? At this point I will do anything to increase my score. I just want to be approved for a regular card in the near future and set myself to be able to be approved for things. 
Please give me your wisdom.

TLDR: I have a secured card with a very low amount. Need tips to try and increase my credit limit because my credit score is moving up at an incredibly slow place. Is it worth sending in more secured funds to increase my limit?"

CreditCards,"I got a new CFU with $500 CL. Got my statement and paid it off immediately. Then I get a notification that my credit score went from 750+ to 696, all because a new account was opened. My score has never gone below 710 before.

This was reported through the Chase App Credit Journey, based on VantageScore 3.0

Is this normal?"
CreditCards,"I currently have about 60000 miles from my Capital One Venture card, which I believe is worth about $600. I know I have the option to transfer those miles to airline partners for better value, but I don't plan on traveling anytime soon due to the virus.

Interestingly though, I came across this page where it says that I can use Venture Miles to cover past purchases on Dining and some Bills.

https://www.capitalone.com/learn-grow/money-management/new-venture-miles-redemption-option/

Based on what I am seeing from my Capital One app, it looks like 1 mile equates to 1 cent when I cover purchases related to dining/bills. Seems to be a fair deal actually. For those who have Venture cards, are y'all going to take advantage of this new method of redeeming Venture Miles? 

FYI, this new method expires at September 30.

EDIT: Made a typo. 1 mile is actually 1 cent."
CreditCards,"* Current cards:
   * Local Banks Cash back (2% back on all purchases), $4,000 limit, opened June 2019
* Credit Score: both the ones on credit karma (vantage) are in the 720's i know you guys don't like those scores but i don't want to pay to get my FICO score.
* Oldest account age: 14 months
* Income: $70,000
* Average monthly spend and categories:spend about 400 dollars a month on credit card and about half of that is on food and entertainment.

Basically my problem is that I only have one credit card, which I've heard is a red flag to credit lenders, but the only cards that would be useful to me are ones that I cant get since I only have one card (recently I've applied for the capital one savor and the wells fargo propel). I'm reluctant to apply for worse/more beginner oriented cards just to build my number of accounts because I really don't see the point of having credit cards for the sake of having them. Is there any way I can Improve my chances of getting a credit card that would be useful to me, mainly the capital one savor or similar alternatives?"
CreditCards,"I currently have a 6-card all cashback setup:

* Amex Blue Cash Preferred (groceries, streaming, gas)
* Wells Fargo Propel (travel, dining, gas, smartphone insurance)
* Capital One Savor One (dining, entertainment)
* Bank of America Cash Rewards (online shopping, pharmacies)
* Chase Freedom (5% quarterly bonus kicker)
* Amex Cash Magnet (non-bonus category spend)

Wondering if it's worth adding the Discover It. From what I understand, the quarterly categories don't often overlap with the Chase Freedom which in theory would give me two 5% category kickers per quarter. There are two things holding me back though:

* The hassle of managing a seventh card with only an incremental rewards increase
* Lack of ancillary benefits (i.e. extended warranty, purchase protection, etc.). I suppose this would only apply to the Amazon quarter and, in fairness, I can't say I've ever actually used these benefits on my other cards

Is the Discover It a worthy add to my set-up? Any alternatives I should consider (only really interested in cash back at this point)?

Thanks much."
CreditCards,I have the premium card and top tier premium rewards. Looking at getting the regular cash rewards card to juice cash back rate but have a few questions.

CreditCards,"Update: It finally went through today. Thanks for the comments that kept me from freaking TF out.

I use my checking account to pay for my Citi Costco credit card. 3 days ago, I made a payment of $600 towards it. On the Citi side, it says the transaction has been posted 2 days ago and the payment was accepted.

However, on the checking account side, there are no transactions stating I transfered any of the money, pending or posted. My account still states I have ""x"" amount of money, even though I technically don't have that $600 I paid towards my credit card.

Should I contact my bank right away, or give it a few days to see if it corrects itself?"

CreditCards,"While searching the forum I never ran across this little known trick to maximize your points to increase their cash back value by 15-40%! 

A lot of cards have different ways of doubling, tripling  or even quadrupling your points by making certain purchases. Example: I have a Amex Gold card that gives me 4x points on Groceries, restaurants. But normally only get a 1 to 1 point redemption on travel. (Don’t know about you guys, I haven’t traveled much during Covid-19)

Here’s the trick!

If I were to simply use my earned points on a recent grocery purchase they only give me roughly 60% point ratio not a true 1 to 1 ratio. So my 75,000 points are not worth $750 cash back but rather $450 on purchase redemptions and only 50% on a direct cash gift cards from Amex. 

Now, Amex lets you redeem your points for gift cards at different stores on Amex website. The point ratio is 60% to 100% depending on company you select. I recently selected a $500 Home Depot Gift Card as it was a 1 to 1 point cost. So $500 only cost me 50,000 points. 

Now, you might be thinking well yeah Reddit stranger but I don’t need a $500 gift card from Home Depot... So here’s the final step. Sell that gift card to a reputable site like CardCash. They gave me $435 cash instantly! So yeah, I’m out $65 but keep in mind Amex was only going to give me 50% on a direct Amex gift card or 60% on a purchase redemption. CardCash gave me equivalent of 87%!  I also have a US Bank Altitude Reserve card and it works exactly the same with them but there points are generally a 1 to 1 point redemption on all purchases anyways. 

Love to hear any other card tricks!"

I go based off Credit karma for my score so I’m not sure if it changes daily or it seriously only refreshes weekly. Please let me know, I can wait a week but I prefer to use the cards again since I’ve waited a few weeks now."
CreditCards,"Hi Reddit,

Recently I had a card stolen online, (this was about 1 month ago) and a person had made 700$+ in purchases. I had charged back the purchases of that month and canceled my card, some purchases from the month were made by me. Recently I have been trying to make purchases from some online stores and they say that the only way I can get my account back is to "" resolve the payment dispute."" Keep in mind it has been around one month since I had marked the purchases fraudulent and was wondering if it was safe to contact the bank and ask them to cancel some of the purchases so I can go back to ordering things online. By the way my bank is Bank of America and I was using a Visa credit Card.

CreditCards,"Hi all, I was approved for the Chase Freedom on 2020-08-19. I was planning to apply for another card (specifically the Amex BCE) in a couple weeks, but now I'm seeing I may need to wait a lot longer than that.

* **Current cards:**
  * TD Cash, $650 limit, opened August 2019 (&gt;1 year)
  * Chase Freedom, $1,300 limit, opened August 2020
* **FICO Score:** 731 Experian FICO 8. Current utilization is 0%. Score should increase a little bit next month. No derogatory marks.
* **Oldest account age:** 12 months
* **Income:** $17,000
* No debt, fortunately.

I'm planning a single big purchase on Amazon, $900–$1500, in the middle of September (Nvidia Ampere!), and would like to put it on a new Amex BCE to get $350 back via the SUB. I'm going to pay it off immediately but I understand this is liable to piss Amex off, so I need some time to put spend on it beforehand so the big purchase isn't a total shock to them. Even if I prepay part of it by overpaying a balance by a few hundred dollars (assuming that's possible), is this just an inherently stupid idea with a new card in these times?

I've heard it's likely the item I want to buy will be incredibly difficult to get hold of at launch and could remain so for at least a month or two, so that would give me some more time to not be doing this with a totally new card, or to wait longer to apply for the new card, but probably not enough time to do both of those. Particularly in the latter case, I *might* be able to get to three months between cards, but definitely not six, so maybe I should just plan to put this purchase on a debit? What do y'all think?

Thanks!"

CreditCards,"In January I received an advertisement from a local spa for buy 3 $200 gift certificates, receive one free. I purchased! Expiration in October. Then the pandemic hit. I contacted the spa over the summer to ask if they'd be extending the bonus expiration date, and they said they expected everything to be fine soon, and would reconsider on a case to case basis later.

Well, September is coming, pandemic is still going strong. I'm high risk, so I can't use these by October. I have to wait until it's safe. I contacted them again to ask if they will extend, and they said no.

In these circumstances, can I do a cc charge back? The gift certificates do not expire, but the free one does. However I wouldn't have purchased any of it wasn't for the free bonus. And I would have used them all right up, if it wasn't for the pandemic! I'm very frustrated at the pressure to use them when it while be unsafe and quite frankly just want my money back now."

CreditCards,"The title pretty much sum it up: Discover will not give me a credit line increase with my current limit being stuck at $1,000.

I've been a Discover member for about 20 months now after my first and only Discover card, the Discover IT Secured, account opened in December 2018. This was my first credit account period. When I first opened that secured account, I set it up with a limit of $300. In about 7 months(July 2019), they graduated me to a unsecured card and sent me my initial $300 deposit back. I never asked for a CLI after that because at the time I didn't know the benefits of asking for one and just assumed that I was stuck with this measly $300 until they automatically gave me some more.

In January 2020, they automatically increased my limit from $300 to $1,000! While this wasn't much of a bump, I was still stoked because they automatically did this without me asking and this was my first card to do so. But since then, I have been unsuccessful every single time when asking for another increase. I was able to successfully product change my card in July 2020 from the Discover IT(unsecured) to the Discover IT Cash Back though.

Since May 2020, I've asked for an increase every 30 days(advice from several forums AND their own customer service reps) and I've gotten the same response, **declined**, and same reason in the letter in the mail 7-10 days later: **""INSUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE WITH CURRENT DISCOVER CARD CREDIT LIMIT""**. I even asked yesterday(8/21/2020) and got this same response while on the phone with the customer service rep. She then transferred me to the actual department that handles these requests to try to give me some more advice and/or a better reason why my requests keep getting declined. After having the next guy look over my account, he even confirmed that I:

1. Always pay my bill in full and keep a low utilization ratio
2. Never missed a payment, sometimes even paying multiple times every month(because the limit is so low)
3. Am using the hell out of the cashback rewards on the card
4. From his point of view, I definitely deserved a bigger limit but there's nothing he can do

But he couldn't even tell me why my requests keep getting declined. His advice was to *just keep trying every 30 days*\- aka the same bs I've been hearing the past 4 months. I just can't figure out how much more *experience* they want me to have after having the same $1,000 for 8 months and being a customer for almost 2 years now???

**So I'm asking for some advice here from you all...** Has anyone else experienced anything similar with Discover? Are they usually this stingy with CLIs or could COVID-19 be a factor here? Is there anything else I could be doing differently?

Has anyone successfully changed the terms of their credit card with balance reconciliation or collections representative? Deferment seems available to everyone, but I'm primarily interested in:

* lowering my interest rate,
* reducing minimum payments (in case financial difficulty gets worse), or
* negotiating a lower balance

Just talking to CC customer service, I'm told that the conversation can change from deferment to other options after you get behind on payments. So, between day 1 of missing payment to day \~30 where the bank reports the late payment, I'm told the bank rep may offer other relief options. Is this true? How does this all work? How many payments do people have to miss before the bank is willing to offer  a lower balance?

Any help is appreciated."

I’ll likely be spending more than usual in the coming months so I am looking for a new CC to capitalize on the SUB. I’m not ruling out the idea of applying for another card now but I am dead set on eventually using the CSR as my go to CC.

Like I said, I’m not exactly sure if I’ll get approved for the CSR so my question is: can I apply for the CSR and if I get rejected apply for the CSP on the same day without risking a second inquiry. If so, am I even likely to be approved for that?"

I hope this helps anyone! I was surprised to hear that my credit limit is only $500. I was expecting a limit of at least $1,000. Also, I'm not sure if this helped my approval, but my credit scores rose a couple points already by the time I called in my confirmation.

is it just how each bank chooses to handle these requests?"
CreditCards,"tl;dr The title. I really want to hear other CSR/AR users comment on this so ignore literally everything below this if it's too much to read, as it's just me explaining my situation if someone wanted an idea.

Was unsure what flair to put on this, but since I don't plan to get these cards anytime soon, I figured *Discussion* was better than *Help.*

I got 4 cards:

* Discover - June/July 2016 - $7,000 balance

* Uber - April 2019 - $2,400 balance (Cancelling this soon, I'm committed)

* Chase Amazon Prime Rewards - January 2020 - $6,500 balance

* Chase Freedom Unlimited - August 2020 - $10,500 balance

Currently 3/24, though it's looking like I'll be 2/24 by the time travel is normal again. My plan initially was, best case scenario next April/July/TBD/normalness I would acquire the CSP first year then upgrade/downgrade to the CSR/CF depending on how my spending seems to go from there.

This is my first year as a fully independent graduate so I'm still trying to get used to how my spending will be normally. Typically speaking, I travel internationally once a year though last year I did travel internationally twice. First trip ~$5,000 and second trip ~$3,000.

At home annually, I'm on track to spend maybe around ~$3,000 on groceries (though like 2/3rd of that will be at Costco, so Wholesale stores), like ~$840 on gas (when things are normal again, I work from home so I've spent like $43 on gas since March), and maybe at most $720 on dining/takeout (including DoorDash and such) when things are normal and I'm out and about. I'm not even including Lyft here since I'm not going out and about in my state for drinks and such so I can't make a good estimate, but I do use Lyft/Uber occasionally. 

Due to desiring to travel at least once a year, the travel credit from the CSR would always be useful so as far as I'm concerned it's $250 per year. The CSR also seems to have travel insurance what I usually pay $100 a trip for (I know it can be cheaper, I just go with Allianz because I heard good things compared to others), so I could effectively see that as $150 a year if I travel once a year?

I know mostly about how the points system works with the Chase Trifecta, where with the CSR your CFU points are like 2.25x, your CF is worth 7.5x and I *think* your CSR 3x points are worth 4.5x through the travel portal? Pretty neat, and I get why the trifecta is valuable (and I know you can't transfer points among your USB cards or to partners)

Now of course, the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve. A card I hadn't considered since I figured it was too hard to acquire but it does seem in some way feasible due to /u/slash8915's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/idc2nv/i_found_an_easy_way_to_open_a_us_bank_checking/). I live where there are no U.S. Bank branches (though I do plan to move one day to a specific state which does happen to have them), though I am concerned about wondering what's stopping them from catching on and just cancelling the card altogether. I heard getting the Cash+ for a while can also work, and it does seem to be a pretty damn nice card without needing to have a checking account with them. But I digress.

The real reason the USB AR draws me in is (just like everyone else it seems) because of the 3x mobile wallet. I use Apple Pay for anything and everything if I can use it and the only two places I frequent that don't allow it are at a small Asian market I pick up a few things from and Costco Gas (though if I'm not near Costco I do go to Exxon which always has Apple Pay). Other than that, everything else is Apple Pay.

$400 annual fee that's effectively $75 annually thanks to the travel credit, comes with 12 free complimentary WiFi passes (not sure if United works with it, but I can't stand not having WiFi so I always buy it), also has Global Entry credit like CSR, real time rewards, and other things I'm missing. It seems like their travel insurance equivalent is much more limited though.

So I'm pretty much wondering whether to go full Chase Trifecta in the future or start establishing a relationship with U.S. Bank via Cash+ &gt; Altitude Reserve or the way /u/slash8915 mentioned. My main concern is that a few months ago, [U.S. Bank was apparently considering nerfing the 3x mobile wallet in favor of 2x](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/u-s-bank-sends-out-survey-regarding-changes-to-altitude-reserve/). From what I read in the past when the card first came out, someone seemed to mention that USB had a tendency to nerf their cards and were only counting down the days until they removed Mobile Wallet. However that was 3 years ago, but that article from a few months ago about nerfing the Mobile Wallet was somewhat worrying. I already got hurt by the Uber Card, and don't want to get Uber Carded by USB assuming I do go through the effort to establish something with them.

Of course, Chase is well able to do something similar for better or worse as they've shown in the past year, so I know they're not immune here either.

I've seen comparisons in the past between these two cards, but not as much regarding the updated $550 AF CSR. So referring back to the title, CSR users what stops you from going with the AR? Even more so if you do use Apple/Google/Samsung Pay often? 

Thanks in advance!"
CreditCards,"I am kind of a noob to the greater world of credit cards, I've been happy with the two I have for the last few years, but now I'm looking for a new daily driver credit card to replace my Amazon Visa.

CreditCards,"Just hit my 91/3 for my first NFCU credit card today (cashRewards) and applied for a credit limit increase on existing card and applied for a new card today (MoreRewards).

All the hype is true - the credit limit increase request on the first card is still pending, which I understand is normal (requested to go from 1k to 5k), but got approved for the second card right away with a limit of 14.5k and an amazingly low APR of 9.65% (my highest limit and lowest APR ever, by far).

The cashRewards card has been my daily driver for the past 3 months since I opened it and I've always made on-time payments and kept utilization pretty low once statement closing date comes around.

I've got nothing but amazing things to say about this credit union - by far the best bank I've ever worked with.

Go NFCU!"
CreditCards,"So I had a question and it might be cause of the pandemic but I recently applied for the CFU and got a credit limit of $4600. Honestly this was lower then I expected cause my last credit card approval was for then CF at $8900 back in March. This is my fifth credit card with a total credit limit of $37,500.

Stats: 
7 yr credit history
Income around $63,000 a year
Credit card approval 2020: January, March and August.

Has anyone else been getting relatively low credit limits?"
CreditCards,"So I was looking into applying for the AR. Realized the perk for “Groundlink Black Car Service” is expiring. 

The company Groundlink will be going out of business, siting COVID-19 as a major contributor. Their last day of business is August 31st.

In the past they had “Silvercar” perks, but now those are gone as well.

Has anyone used these perks using their cards?Are not having these perks a possible deal breaker? Does the card have less value now?"
CreditCards,"So I have my first credit card looking to use it for nothing else than to build credit with a recurring payment I pay monthly on debit anyhow.

If my due date is on the 19th and I have a recurring payment to pay every 13th. On the upcoming 13th it'll be charged to credit, but won't be due until the 19th of the following month because I'm assuming the statement date would originally be the 28th or so of each month. 

Is this correct?"
CreditCards,"

So since the old Amex trifecta is the platinum, gold and Blue business plus with those categories they won’t earn much Membership Reward points so my suggestion is that the new Amex trifecta is Amex Gold, Amex Green, Amex Platinum and your going to get more value and perk since you basically have all personal charge card. 

Here the value breakdown: 
$550(Platinum)+$250 (Gold) + $150 (Green) = 950 Total Annual fee. 

$950(Total Annual Fee)-$200 (Platinum Card Airline Fee Credit - $200 (platinum card Uber Credit $15 a month from January-November and $35 in December) - $100 (platinum Saks Fifth avenue credit) - $100 (Airline Fee Credit Gold card) - $120 (Gold Card Dining Credit $10 a month. = Total Effective annual fee: $230= Great Value!! (After using all credits!)"
CreditCards,"Hi all,

I'm 19, and I got my first CC 5 months ago; the Discover It Student Chrome. My credit score (Vantage) is about a 700, as this is my only account and I've made all of my payments on time with a low utilization rate.

I wanted to get another card a few weeks ago, and I figured that the Amazon prime rewards card with 5% cash back seemed reasonable since I do a lot of Amazon shopping. However, because of my short credit history, I got denied.

I really would like to have another CC open at this point to start building my score faster, but I'm not sure where to go from here.

Should I wait a bit to get another one since I have 2 hard inquires in a 6 month span? Or should I get another one, and which one would you all recommended? I wasn't sure if I should go for a store card, a rotating categories card, or a straight cash-back card.

Thanks in advance!"
CreditCards,"I applied for the CFU and got automatically approved. Then, I started doing research about added points bonus paired with the CSP since I go out to eat at restaurants and will more likely be traveling after the coronavirus is calming down. Can I apply for the CSP the day after the CFU? They did a hard pull on my Equifax report.

Equifax Fico: 754

Income: $25,000

Utilization: 1%

Virtually have zero debt, just like to keep a very small balance to have it report to the bureaus just to show them I'm active."
CreditCards,"UPDATE: Read Amex Application Rules and saw that you could apply for 2 charge cards in 1 day. I had previously been offered the 45k Amex Green Card offer and figured I would see if they would let me apply for both in one day. Applied in an Incognito Mode window and was instantly approved. 


Hello

I was approved today for the Amex Gold 75k SUB for spending $4,000 over 6 months. 

I had my credit frozen with all three bureaus. On Monday August 17, 2020 I unfroze all my credit reports. 

I checked the pre-qualification site on Amex each day since then and kept getting either the 60k offer or the 35k with cash back offer. 

I checked on CardMatch and the only offer was 75k SUB  for spending $4,000 over 3 months. I would not have been able to spend $4,000 over 3 months, but I can easily complete over 6 months. 

Today I went to the Amex pre-qualification site and got the 75k/6 month offer. 

I applied and was instantly approved. 

This is my first lifetime Amex card. 

Current Income Wife and I combined: $80,000

Current FICO score: 809

Average age of accounts: 6 years 7 months

Chase 5/24 status: 4/24 (Freedom Unlimited, Freedom, Amex Gold, Amex Green) 

Also have CIU and CIC which do not count against 5/24. 

Oldest credit card: Sunoco Rewards Plus Mastercard (02/2010)

Hope this helps folks out. Just keep checking every day and hopefully the offer shows up for you."
CreditCards,"When should I apply for my second AmEx?

I applied, and was approved, for my first AmEx card, the Delta Gold card, on July 27th, so my first statement hasn’t even cut yet. However, I want to get the no AF Hilton to start getting points since I see myself staying in many hotels in the future (I’ll of course upgrade it to an Aspire in the future when I can afford it) When would be the best time to apply? I know AmEx typically does a soft pull for a second card, and I’m assuming since I was approved for a card with an AF, they’d have no problem giving one without?"
CreditCards,"Wife and I are going through the IVF process soon and will have about $25,000 in medical bills over the next 6 months (and more if we have to do a second round). I'm looking for advice on the best way to take advantage of this large organic spending.

150k Income, credit in the 800s for both of us, 6+ inquiries each

P1 cards - CF, CFU, CIP, CSP, WOH, Chase Amazon Prime, US Bank AR, Citi Costco. 4/24

P2 cards - CFU, CIP, CSP, Store Card, 3/24 (CFU was picked up last month for the grocery benefit)

Other notes

* If we conceive we probably won't do any airline travel for at least 2 years
   * I don't mind sitting on the travel points for a few years as we have family internationally and will begin vising them again after the baby is a bit older
   * Not too interested in other hotel cards right now but may consider a P2 WOH card if that is the best option
   * I don't travel for work so all travel perks are for leisure travel
* I'm looking at Amex gold cards and BBP cards but there would still be a significant amount of spend available after getting those
   * No current Amex relationship (previously had Amex Costco card before Citi conversion)
   * We would ultimately keep 1 gold card and 1 BBP
   * I have not been targeted for the 100k or 125k plat
* I'll be keeping my CIP but we will be downgrading both CSP, and P2 CIP when renewals hit (unless we get retention offers)
   * Next chase sapphire bonus in 2023
   * After IVF process we will probably take a break from new apps to go back below 5/24
* Not interested in the 15k spend bonus night on the WOH card
* I was not targeted for the 4% amazon prime bonus
* The spend will be in person and mobile wallet is not an option
   * Visa, MC, Amex, Discover accepted

Thank you for your thoughts!"
CreditCards,"I was looking at AMEX's site and saw a couple new SUBs that I hadn't heard of before. I'm not in the market for either of these cards, but they're interesting, even if they aren't far and away the best for either of them. I got both of the unique components in a few private windows, so both seem possible to get by cycling private windows.

[**Amex Gold:**](https://i.imgur.com/WvN7oNU.png) Smaller portion of MR points, plus a 10% back on all spend up to a limit via statement credits. Both seem to have a six month time frame. The one I saw first was 35,000 MR points on $4,000 spend plus 10% back up to $250. This comes out to $600 back, but part of it is not given as MR points so you lose the relative value boost of MR points. Therefore I don't see the benefit over the popular 60,000 MR point SUB. The smaller portion of course requires less spend to get, but if you can't hit the full SUB I don't know why you'd get a Gold.

[**Amex Cash Magnet:**](https://i.imgur.com/tXhkgFJ.png) 10% back up to a limit at supermarkets only, plus a standard cashback statement credit after a minimum spend. Again, both seem to have a six month time frame. The one I saw first was 10% up to $150 plus $150 back after $1,000 in spend. Looking at the SUBs shown on [rankt](https://rankt.com/cards/amex_cash_magnet/) for this card, this seems like a straight up improvement. The highest SUB there is $250 back, and to oversimplify, it's after a total of $7,500 in spend in the first year. This new SUB requires a minimum (if fully optimized) of $1,500 in spend in six months, which is a lot more attainable for the type of user who would want a Cash Magnet. This seems like a response to Chase's Freedom/Freedom Unlimited grocery cashback SUBs, and does certainly make it superior to the FU if you can hit the spend in six months instead of a year.

I'm pretty new here so I don't know if SUBs this complex have existed before, but these are both very interesting SUBs that may be good for some individuals. Thanks for reading!"
CreditCards,I use eBay a lot and the $150 back on your first $500 is enticing
CreditCards,"Hello all,

I'm 27 with 0 credit. Should I get a gas card to build initially? Keep getting denied for more typical cards due to no history. I'm in zero debt and in good a standing financially, I just really need to start building my credit. I feel so behind!

 If anyone has any tips/recommendations for someone in my position or the best card for a beginner I would appreciate it. Planning on using this card to pay off small everyday items like groceries and gas.

Thanks and all the best"
CreditCards,"Hello everyone,

My friend recently used my referral link to apply for the CSP. Initially, they didn't approve him immediately, as they needed some additional documents. About two weeks later, after providing everything they needed, he called them and they approved him immediately. 

I just want to make sure I will still get the bonus considering the delay and all that.

Thank you!"
CreditCards,"I am not sure, it might be only debit cards but I work at a hotel and we do not get the money until the next day at like 2am or sometimes checkout, but some peoples cards get the money sliced off of them the second we input the card in the system. It makes for a lot of sticky situations. 

My cards never do that and I have like every card. It would be easier to ask me ""hey do you have x card"" than to ask what cards I have. I have discoverit, two cap 1s (platinum and savor) PayPal Mastercard, a credit union card, a Macy's amex. A regular amex cashback, and a Citi thankyou card. I'm probably leaving at least one out, and leaving all of my store cards out. My debit card has nearly the opposite problem, as purchases and card payments stay pending on my acct for about 5 days no joke, or don't even show up for days before that.


This last paragraph is me being petty:

I honestly hate that I'm like so bitter but I hate having to deal with people who don't have more than one card to use and look at me like a codfish when I say that I can't do anything about how their card company handles our authorization. But the amount of times I text my husband to rant that a GROWN ASS WOMAN/MAN doesn't have money to spare on an emergency card or they're bitching about how long it takes for authorization to fall off of their card... like... I'm 21 in 6 days. I have like 20k in credit and use like maybe 2k per cycle, which includes my husbands purchases.... But like I just bug eye at people who don't have any backup. Like. The authorization is imaginary money for me! If I get it refunded in 30 days it's the same as never spending it even if it hit my acct. It's wild to me that people put up with garbage banks that aren't pro-customer."
CreditCards,"I applied for the CSR about 2mo ago and was denied but never found out why. I currently have a car loan out for ~17k, have a closed student loan account that was closed about a year ago and have 2 student loans that were closed about 3 years ago. Ive been on my parent's Sears credit card which is about 42 years old and has a 15k limit with currently 1% utilization and my annual income is about 70k.

According to CK, my credit is about 806, which is why I thought I could get the CSR. Obviously that was probably a bit optimistic, but I'd still like the CSP.

My question is, should I apply for the CSP and risk getting denied again, leavimg me with 2 hard inquiries in 2mos, or should I play it safe and try to apply for something like the CFU? If so, how long could I expect it to take to be able to upgrade to the CSP? I like the Chase cards because I do a decent amount of traveling and the benefits from those seem like they're the best.

Thank you in advance and if anyone thinks other cards would be better, that would be appreciated as well!"
CreditCards,"Just found this sub and I see that others have had their credit limit decreased as well. Mine went from $5000 to $1500. It’s my oldest CC, but I have not used it in years. I didn’t realize I was supposed to be keeping it active in that way, but now I know better! My Fico score decreased from
808 to 793 from June to July. Wondering what course of action I can take here to preserve my good credit? Should I ask for my limit to be increased and risk a hard check? Or just start using the card again? 

I have been affected by the pandemic as I am in the restaurant biz, still have a job but now more than ever I want to make sure I am doing everything I can to be smart credit wise."
CreditCards,"I just applied for the Propel since I don't really plan on making use of my premium travel cards for quite some time. After I submitted the application, to my surprise I saw pending. I've always been instantly approved for credit cards, so I was a little shocked.

Is WF buckling down on credit card apps because of COVID, or is this actually pretty normal? If it makes a difference, I have no relationship with WF what so ever.

UPDATE: I just called in and was approved with a $12k limit. I asked why it went into pending status, and the rep told me it was 100% because I had no relationship with them, and they wanted to verify that it wasn't fraud.

Data points:
They pulled Experian which is by far my lowest score at 780 - 
0/6 3/12 -

CreditCards,How long until I can get a Credit One CLI? My account has been open for 8 months and I pay my balance in full every month.
CreditCards,"So I’m a little confused about paying of credit card balances to build credit. Let’s say I have a new Chase card and I’m in the first month of spending. Is it the case that if I buy something for $200 and maybe 3 days later pay off my balance, then it won’t be building credit? So I want to buy something for $200, let that sit for 30 days until I get a statement with a balance, and *then* pay that off to build credit? Or am I just way off in both accounts haha Any help is appreciated!"
CreditCards," 

I plan on traveling a lot after I graduate, so I want to get a decent travel card with good rewards. However, my income and short history makes it seem like it is not possible at this point.

I love the rewards programs so i want to apply for another one with good rewards. I last applied for a card in March , would applying for another card now be too soon? Should i wait longer?"
CreditCards,"I applied for the WF Propel yesterday and was denied. I’m basically focused on just getting a card which has phone insurance and no annual fee, while building my credit foundation of cards I will never *need* to close.

What I have so far: 

- discover student card since February 2019 with limit of $4800 (paid off every month less than 10% until)
- Amex cash magnet since June 2020 with limit of $8900 (paid off every month, hanging onto $2k balance just because 0% APR offer) 

Other info:
- no missed payments 
- only loan history I have is two mentioned cards
- last inquiry was about 21 hours ago
- oldest account 1 year 7 months

Considering my fun with WF yesterday, should I wait it out on applying maybe another six months or is Barclays more reasonable? I don’t want to do another hard pull only to find out they’re just as strict as Wells Fargo. 

Thanks in advance!"

How much longer should I make my payments before I attempt to refinance? I know that because I missed payments that my Fico auto score is probably not in a good spot compared to my regular credit score and that company's probably will not refinance me at this point due to having missed payments, but wanted to know what steps to take from here. Any help and advice is appreciated."

CreditCards,"So I've had the Capital One Platinum card for 9 months and recently been shopping around for credit cards with cash back rewards. A few days ago I applied for the Capital One Quicksilver and got auto-denied but I followed the one link someone posted for upgrading your card and I got auto-aproved for the upgrade from Platinum to Quicksilver. I got an email saying that I was denied again but then my card was on the way and I can see my cash back rewards on the app/website already so success?? But then I decided that I should apply for the Discover It Platinum card and Chase Freedom. I went for Freedom first because I figured it would be a harder card to get and was auto-denied; called up Chase and the reasons were my current credit limits, credit history too new, and too many recent inquiries. After doing recon I was denied again but only for history and inquiries. I'm not sure what I should do, I'm looking for cash back and to build my credit.

For reference:
Score is 710-730 (Always paid balance in full on time)

CreditCards,"My score is 625 and only cc I can get are like $300
And crazy fees and such I like to get a decent card to build my score up so I can buy a house and other things

CreditCards,"If I use my Discover card to buy $1500 worth of Walmart GCs using PayPal and get $150 cashback (first year), I now have a CC balance of $1500 plus I have $1500 tied up in Walmart. Plus I’m sure PayPal will take a cut.

I understand most may pay off their $1500 CC balance in full so interest is not accrued but this strategy seems like a lot of hassle for ~$150. 

I guess because the $150 is “free money” this strategy is suggested so much? Is there anything I’m missing? Or is there a better way to maximize this strategy?"
CreditCards,"So first off I am trying to get a card with no annual fee, which has phone insurance and is with a somewhat big bank. I’ve narrowed it down to two cards: 
- WF Propel 
- JetBlue Card (insurance included since it’s a world MasterCard)

I applied for the WF propel yesterday and was promptly denied. Asked for a reconsideration and was again promptly denied. 

According to my credit report I’m sitting at 710. 

I’ve got two cards so far: 
- Amex cash magnet with $8,900 limit (had since June 2020) 
- Discover student card with a $4,500 limit(since Feb 2019). 

Other useful info 
- income: 60,000

I pay both of my cards in full every month with the exception of right now with the Amex I’m keeping like 20% on it because 0 APR until 2021. Is it possible this is harming me? I’m just keeping the balance so I can gain interest on the money in a savings account. 

Oldest account: February 2019 
- No missed payments
- Only lending history I have is credit cards

Should I try applying for the Barclays JetBlue Card or will they strike me down as well? Basically I’m not looking to just burn through inquiries, and I’m not finding as much information on how strict Barclays is. With a quick search through here it’s obvious WF is very picky, especially with this card. 

My inquiry with WF was made about 18 hours ago, and I’m wondering if it would make more sense before this inquiry posts  before applying for the other one. Is it possibly already too late too? I already got the discover identity protection message saying an inquiry happened yesterday. I see mixed information on how long it takes for a hard pull to show on your report from the lenders perspective.

As mentioned above, I'm looking for direction. I want to upgrade my Best Buy Card to the Platinum version to not get hit with the $59 AF and raise my piss poor limit on the card. But the hotline representative told me the only way was to close out the account and re-apply for the Platinum version. I'm assuming doing this will result in a hard pull. If that's the case, I was looking to apply for a different card all together, one that helps with travel and/or groceries. The Amex Propel Card looked good to me.

The CSR also looked great, but I don't see myself getting to $4k in 3 months without doing some extra spending or supplementing my income lol...I don't mind paying annual fees, so long as the card's benefits are worth it."

1 hard inquiry showing on CK

No derogatory marks, never been late on a payment. 

What I am trying to do is transfer a balance from a card with 0% APR is expiring, because I am doing well in the stock market and want to keep more cash invested, while still keeping my more than sufficient emergency fund in savings, and pay off this balance over time. I applied for Chase Slate because 0% APR with $0 balance transfer fee. You currently have to apply in branch, that card is not available online. I have no idea why I got such a low limit. I started thinking maybe the banker misunderstood what I told her for my income and everything, as due to covid I could not touch the keyboard and was speaking through a mask to tell her my financial information, and didn't get to review everything before it was submitted. I called the number on the card and was told even if there was a mistake, I would have to request a limit increase with an additional hard inquiry. I decided to cut my losses and just apply for something with 3% balance transfer fee, assuming I was essentially guaranteed approval whereas the increase on the Chase card seemed less certain.

I also moved in the last two months. When I applied for the Slate card it was originally declined, so the banker said I would have to use my previous address, which I never officially submitted a change of address or anything and can still get mail there as it is a relative's house. On the Citi application I used my previous address since the banker at Chase recommended I do that if I apply for anything else. 

Any advice or am I just going to have to pay the card off? I have the cash its just not the ideal situation in my mind but I am running out of time.

I'm really just stumped as to how I got such a low limit and then completed denied on what seems like an easy to get card. CK listed the Citi card as 100% approval odds if that means anything.

Greatly appreciate any input"
CreditCards,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been reading a lot about how to trigger a chase auto cli and had a clarifying question. One of the ways I’ve been seeing is to use more than the limit on the card each month and then PIF. So take my FU card which has a low $500 limit, does that mean charge up near 80-90% let it close and then PIF or does that mean use it a lot through the month but pay frequently through the month so that it closes with a low balance still? 

Sorry if this is a newbie question. I’ve been rebuilding my credit and about 3 months ago I finally was able to get the CSP at $5k and the FU at $500. Just trying to see if or how I can trigger an auto cli for better utilization."
CreditCards,"I’ve been tracking my credit with browell and credit karma for several months now but I’ve noticed a difference in the scores. This doesn’t really make sense to me!
Firstly with browell, my credit score will go up/down with differences in my credit utilization. It also went down after applying for a loan and a new credit card.
Here’s where things don’t make sense... with credit karma my score only seems to be going down.
My score hasn’t improved with less credit utilization.. my score has only gone down with the new credit card and loan. Obviously my score will do down but the problem is it NEVER goes up on credit karma.
Additionally my score is off about 15 points between the two and when I took out my new credit card there were differences in the points deductions.
If anyone could explain this I would really appreciate it!"
CreditCards,"Hi all, quick question regarding the Uber Visa Cellphone Protection. Currently, my bill is being charged to a different card. Will the protection become active the day after I charge my next bill on the Visa? Currently have a phone w/ a broken screen and degraded battery that I was hoping to fix. From their terms and conditions as to what is NOT covered: ""Cosmetic damage to the cell phone or damage that does not impact the cell phone's capabilities and functionalities"". I figure this eliminates the screen, but I was hoping the battery would count, and perhaps since the report from Apple states both issues, Barclay would end up covering both.

Long story short, just looking to see when my phone becomes eligible. I'll see if I'm denied by myself, although any anecdotes are welcome."

* Funds deposited in 3-4 days from now.
* My credit score is mid 700's
* I have recent work history and docs to prove.
* I don't have any issues with sending in my drivers license etc
* A lot of loan companies require you to log into your account to confirm identity and direct deposit history from your employer. I can't do this because I used to deposit my checks into my ex-husbands account. There needs to be an alternative to send them proof like pay check stubs or something.

Anyone knows any good companies? If you could simply put a link to their site or tell me their name I would appreciate it sooo much. My husband and I just got a divorce, and I am still living in his home. If I have to wake up to seeing the woman he cheated on me with in this house one more morning I might jump off a bridge.

I applied a few places and am still waiting on an answer weeks later.

CreditCards,"I currently have the CSP since 2/2020 and I was planning to go the route of the CSP/CFU combo. I got the CSP because I had a lot of travel plans, but because of COVID i don't see myself traveling anytime soon. I also heavily underestimated my spending on restaurants/groceries which is why I've been looking into the AMEX gold especially since I have the 75k point offer.

I was thinking of downgrading the CSP to a CFU before the annual fee hits, but I'm unsure on what this will do to the points I accumulated. Will I still be able to redeem through the chase portal after I downgrade or transfer it to airline/hotel ?

From what I understand AMEX gold is still a decent travel card with redeeming at 3x for flights and some travel benefits. Would I be making a better decision to switch to AMEX or should I start the CSP/CFU combo?  I also plan on starting gradschool in the next year so I don't think if I were to upgrade to a CSR i would fully benefit from the card.

CreditCards,"I've been seriously looking at the AR because it seems to give the most overall perks for the lowest effective annual fee. I also have a Galaxy S20 Ultra, so Samsung Pay makes the mobile wallet perk super easy to use. However, you need a previous relationship with US Bank in order to apply for it, and since none of their other credit cards can pool points with the AR, I didn't want to waste an inquiry on them.

I live in Dallas, TX so there aren't any branches even remotely close to me. I applied for their Gold Checking account through the ""Because you've earned it"" portal so that I can avoid fees. I got instant denied because of my location.

I did some more digging and found out that their brokerage accounts are open to anyone. The self-managed one has no fees other than a $50 annual fee which is collected at the beginning of the calendar year. I decided to try and open one with the intent of closing it before the beginning of the year. I applied and got instant approved. During the setup process, it gave me the option to open an online banking account with [usbank.com](https://usbank.com) I created an account, then went back to the gold checking application and applied again while logged in.

This time, it was instantly approved! So now I have the fee-free version of the Gold checking account which will give me the required relationship with US Bank to apply for the Altitude Reserve. I just thought this little loophole might be useful for someone else that's in my situation."

CreditCards,"Hi, I don't want annual fee cards because I won't be traveling much for the foreseeable future, nor spending a lot of money (starting physician residency next year).  My strategy is

* Discover It card and use it for 5% on the rotating categories ( I already have the card)
* American Express Blue Cash Everyday for 3% at grocery stores, apply before I need to make a large purchase so I can use the intro offer (can't use the Amazon discount since it doesn't apply to gift cards). Will be in late Spring 2021 when I have to move.
* Citi double cash mastercard 2% back all other spending (get now since no intro offers)
* Later on get a Chase Freedom Card and use it same way as Discover
* Much later, look at annual fee cards when I make more money (after residency is finished)
* Currently have a local bank Visa with poor rewards so just sockdrawer it.

What do you think?"
CreditCards,As the title says I am thinking of paying off a closed credit card with a balance that I have been making payments on. A few years ago the creditor lowered my interest rate to 0 and closed out the account at my request for a hardship plan. So my question is this closed account factored into the age of my accounts? Or since it is closed would it not? I just want to know if I will see a temporary dip in my score if I pay it off.
CreditCards,"I haven't applied yet, but I was planning on applying for a discover it card, like the Discover It Secured v. Discover It Cash Back. What is the best way to increase your credit score in terms of paying every month? My banker told me it's best to use 20-30% of the credit card's line and only pay back a few so every month you can seem to be active since the APR rate is \~20%. I thought paying everything back in full every month is the goal so it shows that you are a responsible user, and thus, increase your credit score.

What do you all think? I wanted to make sure I know what to do before I get approved."
CreditCards,"I want to close out one of my credit cards that I've had for a couple of years. I'm worried about closing with a negative reward balance.

I have a negative reward balance because I spent the reward points and then received a refund on a hotel. I was wondering if closing the account with the negative balance will be an issue. Would this affect my FICO score? Would I technically be in debt to the credit card company?

Thanks!"
CreditCards,"I have never used PayPal before but the only reason I created an account was to earn 5% back on the Discover card, so I was thinking of just purchasing gift cards on their site. I have messaged them so many times and they keep telling me their system isn't letting me purchase gift cards due to ""security reasons"" and it's keeping me ""safe"". They also tell me to contact the merchant (which is actually PayPal itself) to find our solution, or use another payment method. I have tried testing my debit card, other credit cards, and even my direct checking account on the site and it still won't let me purchase gift cards. 

Anybody have better luck? I know that restaurants also count for the 5% category this quarter, so I was thinking of just purchasing $1,500 in gift cards for different restaurants. I really wanted to buy Walmart gift cards so I can shop at Walmart and Sam's Club"

The merchant also doesn't accept returns on their items, opened or not which I find baffling (this isn't an independent seller or anything).

# Bust Out

Bust-out fraud, also known as sleeper fraud, is primarily a first-party fraud scheme. It occurs when a consumer applies for and uses credit under his or her own name, or uses a synthetic identity, to make transactions. The fraudster makes on-time payments to maintain a good account standing, with the intent of bouncing a final payment and abandoning the account.

During the process, the fraudster builds up a history of good behavior with timely payments and low utilization. Over time, he or she obtains additional lines of credit and requests higher credit limits. Eventually, the fraudster uses all available credit and stops making payments. Overpayments with bad checks are often made in the final stage of the bust-out, temporarily inflating the credit limit and causing losses greater than the account credit limit. \[[source](https://www.experian.com/assets/decision-analytics/white-papers/bust-out-fraud-white-paper.pdf)\]

# Synthetic

Synthetic *identity* fraud is a technique where a fraudster creates an identity using a mix of personal information from different people or a combination of real and fake personal information. Fraudsters use synthetic identities primarily for application fraud, a form of fraud where a bad actor uses a stolen or synthetic ID to apply for a line of credit or a loan with no intention of paying back the lender. Synthetic identity fraud is difficult to detect because fraudsters often hide behind identities and emulated behavior that makes them look like authentic, real people. Fraudsters will mimic credit growth of a real person before they start to bust out on multiple loans. \[[source](https://www.datavisor.com/blog/blog-synthetic-identity-theft-when-credit-risk-is-not-credit-risk/)\]

# Pollinator

*(This was a bit harder to find since most results were talking about - shocker here - pollen.)*

A pollinator is an individual who adds additional authorized users to their lines of credit as an enabler for those authorized users to subsequently open their own lines of credit in order to commit fraud with that established credit history.

The authorized user process is how most synthetic IDs are created. Adding authorized users to an account is legal and allowable by credit card issuers. It is typically used for legitimate purposes, such as adding a spouse or a child. Fraudsters exploit the authorized user process and actively recruit cardholders with good credit to add unknown people/identities to their card, often for just several days. Using this technique, often referred to as “piggybacking,” the legitimate cardholder receives a fee for adding the authorized user identity to his or her account. A credit card is not issued to the authorized user; it simply sits on the credit account for a period and “inherits” the card owner’s credit history. Once the trade lines have reported to the CRAs, the synthetic identity can be removed from the account as an authorized user, but the credit history is retained. The fraudster will then apply for credit with multiple card issuers. With multiple credit lines successfully obtained, the fraudster will max out all the credit lines by buying gift cards and valuable merchandise such as smartphones and other electronics that can be easily sold. \[[source](https://acquirerrisk.com/synthetic-identities-pollinators-and-money-laundering/)\] \[[source](https://securityintelligence.com/synthetic-identity-theft-three-ways-synthetic-identities-are-created/)\]

CreditCards,"Going through Chase Freedom benefits, it seems extended warranty adds 1 year on any warranty that is 3 years or less:

*Extends the time period of the U.S. manufacturer's warranty by an additional year, on eligible warranties of 3 years or less.*

I thought, for warranties of less than 1 year, extended warranty is only doubled. E.g. for my 90 day warranty, I would only get extra 90 days. Do I actually get a full year on top of 90 days?"

Lyft will be stopping operations in California tonight because of a ruling requiring them to classify drivers as employees.  Some of the benefits for the Chase Sapphire Reserve are Lyft Pink membership and 10x points on Lyft rides.

Since that means some of us can't use those perks anymore, I'm hoping they'll substitute the benefit for something else, but I kind of doubt it because it's not nationwide.  Does anyone else have any more info about this?

I've heard that if your balance is always paid back, ie your balance is 0 when the credit bureaus report, then your careful spending backfires because it looks like you aren't using your credit at all.

I don't really know how that figures into what I'm doing. Would utilization percentage only matter if you're carrying a balance? It's all still kinda confusing to me. Any advice?"

When I applied for that card I did the discover prequal and was denied.. fast forward to today.. 

I did the discover prequal again and was pre approved for the Discover it Secured. Would it be wise to go for it or wait a longer period and try the prequal again to see if I can get a regular card? 

Also I know the form says it does not harm your credit score but would it be a issue if I did the prequal again in a few days? I just realized my transunion score updates in a few days and that’s who they use."

My husband is Active duty air force, and has never opened one and doesn’t have anything established, grew up old school and pays cash for everything including cars. 

We travel a lot and were thinking about getting him an AMEX card since being air force waived the annual fee, and the travel lounges would be worth it? 

I know some of you may say we don’t NEED four credit cards - i understand. The first two caption one cards are from when i was 18, they’re only high interest and no rewards. They’re used for gas and utilities. The USAA card was for a better interest rate.

CreditCards,"Hey guys... So I feel like complete shit because I was just going through my credit card statement from early August and saw a purchase made for $150 through Ebay. Keep in mind, I do NOT have an Ebay account so I’m like really nervous and stressed thinking that someone might have gotten my credit card info.

I called my bank, BofA, and they were extremely nice and disputed the transaction and I got the money back. Fast forward to now (2 hours later) I just remembered that I gave my card to my father who said he wanted to buy a gift for my mom, and that it would be great if we could use my card for the rewards. This literally escaped my mind at the time of the dispute and now I feel really really bad.

How do banks deal with these sort of disputes? Do they basically take the money away from the Ebay seller, or does the bank have money in hand to basically pay back the owner of the card? I don’t want to have to repay the Ebay seller (apparently the purchase was through Paypal).

Thank you guys. I know this is a learning opportunity to not give my card away not even to family members and to be more mindful next time but fuck.... I feel so bad now."

CreditCards,I’m a 19 year-old college student and I have one credit card. I’ve been using it every month and I pay the bill on time (7-10 days before the due day).

CreditCards,"Does anyone know how to see the status of your promotional 0% balance transfers at Capital One? My Home Depot, Amazon, and Citi cards all have an easy to find tab that shows you the remaining promotional balance and when it expires, but I can't find something similar on the Capital One site. Thanks in advance for the help!"
CreditCards,"I got a warning from credit monitoring that my FICO dropped. Checked and I saw that, without checking with me, Capital One cut the credit limit on my 2% back Spark card by two thirds-- a card I routinely charge substantial amounts on each month AND a card with an annual fee. (No credit issues.)I have had monthly charges close to the the new limit in the last year, and above the new limit in the past, so this could be tight to keep using this as a main card. I called support and they said they could not reverse it, nor could they answer how this huge credit cut helps Capital One.Since I have other cards with the same 2% perk and no fee, I can cancel this card with little further damage to my credit score and never face the fee again. I have plenty of unused utilization on other cards, and no other card has done a big cut like this.

It seems like Capital One is telling me to cancel the card outright, as they clearly don't value my business or care about getting to charge the fee again. Anyone else run into this inexplicable conduct? How does this anti-customer behavior make sense?

EDIT:

Welp, it's a known thing now. And pretty despicable. Is Capital One betting on a huge crash?

When the Apple Card was introduced I thought it was neat and applied, I like no numbers on the physical card and the supporting app seemed like an interesting way to engage with the infrastructure. My issue is that my Apple Card has been compromised twice in the last year. I’ll be first to admit that it’s easy to change the card numbers and correct the situation but none of that is done by the Apple/ Sachs.

Figured it be completely worthless if it’s only on the $10 and not the overall total. Only my MasterCard debit card doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees. And I’m not sure my Wells Fargo Propel card would be always be accepted there. Otherwise that’d be my main card for no foreign fees."

I want to make some tech purchases for my business right away and am seeking a higher credit availability. Should I apply for a new card or should I only be requesting limit increases from my existing cards? I do need it soon and in the past, credit limit increases have taken months to go into effect so that’s why I was thinking of just applying for another card. My Experian has led me to believe I have a “thin file” and should get another card to help that, but then I read on here that if I get another card I will hurt my average age of accounts. It is possible that we could be looking to buy a house at some point so I do want to know if a new card would be a bad move.

A little about me; I'm a 22F in america with a 660 credit score. Only loan out is about 5k in student loans (I'm no longer a student).

I've been thinking about this for a couple years and have had a very had time finding one I like, and now that I'm thinking long term things like buying a car or home I've decided i should get one.

CreditCards,"So from all of the research I’ve done, and following experiences from others on this sub, it seems like you need the CF, CFU, and CSP/CSR to get the most out of the Chase UR system.

I’m weighing my options out on where I want to open my next card, and personally I’m leaning towards Amex Gold since I eat out often, and I can still cash in MR for travel.

I already have a solid cash back card with the Discover IT, and it’s become my daily driver, but I’d like start banking points for travel in the next few years now that travel restrictions are starting to loosen up.

CreditCards,"Hi all,

I got new Green and Plat cards fairly recently (60 days). The Green, I know was tested up to at least 33K limit using the online tool. I got the Plat a couple of weeks ago. To satisfy the SUB, I started buying precious metals that I needed anyway -- only about $8K worth. All the spend until recently was just a few hundred dollars (I had just rebuilt my Amex relationship with an Optima with $1100 limit).

Just today, they stopped both cards (and I think my Optima). I called the 800# on the website, and I was transferred to talk to my assigned guy. Long story short, he asked about income and what the charges were about. The income matches the applications in April (Green) and July (Plat), 2020, but is more than TY2019 taxes. The charges were about diversifying my assets to match my current risk strategy as I was a little cash heavy.

Wtf is it to you, Amex guy?! (Just kidding :)

Here's the catch; roughly 6 months ago I switched back from public to private sector, and got a pay bump of 40%+, which matches my applications, so I did not lie. However, this would \*not\* match last year's taxes, which was less. I told the guy twice and he said he would notate, that I did not mislead them and that I don't want some silly process to close all of my cards (shoot first and ask questions later), and that I have paystubs I can show. He said ""don't worry about it, it's not for that"".

They want form 4506T to send to the IRS. This authorizes the release of the taxes (for TY2019). The IRS is to return a transcript for only TY2019 to an Equifax company, that does the processing for Amex. According to them, this is income verification.

My questions:

1. I have the guy's contact info and he'll be owning the issue until it's done. Should I tell him anything/do anything?
2. Is there anything else to try to slip in there like the more recent pay stubs? They would get filtered out by the guy when he sent it to the IRS, but at least they would have them and couldn't claim they didn't know.
3. Any other advice? (I hear these are routine and shouldn't be sweated too hard). Any automation to avoid that will cancel things and ask questions later?
4. I hear that if you get 2 FRs for the same thing (specific example was to send money to a person of the same billing address via PayPal), you get all cards cancelled and possible blacklist. Is that true? Can I no longer buy metals with these (or risk getting cards canceled).
5. Should I pay it all off ASAP? I could just pay it all off. Would that make any different with the guys in ""back office"" doing the evaluation?
6. Will I have an opportunity to explain anything from the point after they get the tax analysis back from the Equifax company?
7. Who will venture to guess the reason?  The buying of precious metals?  Unusual spend?  New account?  Previous history of missed payments (5 years ago)?  All of the above?  :)

Thanks!"

I never called the recon line for that..then about 2 months later applied for the freedom and was denied for that as well this time saying ""delinquency or other derogatory relationship with our bank."" As well as ""insufficient funds in an associated banking or investment account with us."" Its been a couple weeks and still haven't called the recon line wanted see if i can get any advice on here. TU 771 EQ 751 no missed payments. Average age of credit 2yrs 1 month. Had 5 inquires before being denied for both CC's."
CreditCards,"Hi everybody!

The title sums it up. I suddenly got a notification from CreditKarma that I had hard inquiry from ""Citibank Na., Best B"" and then below it it says ""Television &amp; Radio"". I have no idea where this came from? I have not applied for anything or had anybody do a credit check on me for an apartment or a loan or anything like that.

Does anybody recognize the name? What's with the ""Best B"" after the name?

These are the credit cards I have:

\- Chase Freedom Unlimited  
\- Citi Diamond Preferred (though here I have literally not done anything with it. My first card was a citi secured card so I could build up my score and then they automatically upgraded me to this once my score was higher)  
\- Amazon Store Card  


If this was from Citibank wouldn't it just say ""CBNA"" without the whole ""best b"" and ""television and radio"" thing. Is that Best Buy? I'm guessing this means somebody is trying to open a card there under my info?"
CreditCards,"Hello all, I'm currently in the process of signing up for cards from the Chase trifecta and my wife is doing the same so as to benefit her individual credit more as well (we've decided to focus on this more recently and have some catching up to do in terms of building up our scores). I currently have a Sapphire Preferred and a Freedom Unlimited, while she has a Freedom Unlimited. The intention is to apply for a Freedom next for myself, and either a Sapphire Preferred or a Freedom card. If I'm not mistaken, she could sign up for the Preferred next, then the Freedom in a few months, and after the first year of the Preferred, downgrade that card to a Freedom/Unlimited while being able to claim all the sign up bonuses. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this and if this is in fact the most effective way to obtain the ""Chase Trifecta"" while gaining the most sign-up bonuses between the two of us."
CreditCards,"I made it to 365 days of having my first (and only) credit card on 2020-08-14, and though some here suggested waiting for September first so it was definitely a year of history, I decided to apply before that since the timing works a lot better for me and I figured I could recon and push the application through.

Stats at the time of the application:

* 1 card: TD Cash, 368 days old, CL $650. 0% utilization (due date is ~3 days before statement date...).

* Experian: FICO 8: 750. 3 hard inquiries, all at least 12 months old. No derogatory marks.

* Chase 5/24 status: 1/24.

* Income: $17,000.

I had opened a Chase checking account on 2020-06-15. I have a few thousand in there now and have been using it as my normal account, probably at least 20 actions since creation. I did not have any prequal offers in there; probably due in no small part to the account being very new.

I applied on 2020-08-17. They pulled Experian, but I'm not sure if they also pulled TU or EQ. Got the ""We have received your request for a Chase credit card. We'll let you know our decision as soon as possible"" on the webpage and an email. Called the status line and got the 30 day message. Called the recon line, asked if they needed any information from me. They did the text message verification code, then said there was nothing more to say at this time. Called the status line twice the next day, 30 day message both times.

Today, 2020-08-19, I got a call from Chase around 1 PM. They asked for verbal confirmation that I had applied, confirmed my name, and said they would finish up the application on the phone; after a minute they said I had been approved with a $1,300 credit line! I was transferred to a customer service rep to request expediting the card; they said it should be here in 1-2 days. Checking my account, I got the 23.74% highest APR, but that doesn't really matter and I'm glad to have gotten a sizable bump from my first card's line (especially since I'm going to also apply for the BCE in a couple weeks).

Thanks for the help, everyone! Glad to start my Chase Trifecta."

My score is pretty good at a 740 but I dont have any loans or any other credit history other than the one card that I'm an authorized user on. I tried to apply for a capital one secured card but didnt get approved. Im thinking that this has to do with the lack of stable income and very limited credit history.

If y'all would recommend a ecured card, I would prefer one that doesnt have a high deposit (looking for around $150 max).

CreditCards,"I signed up for a Capital One Venture card last December and hit the 50,000 mile bonus requirement. I was expecting to be able to use the bonus miles but because of Covid-19 I haven't been able to make many purchases that qualify as travel expenses.

CreditCards,"Hey!

I tend to be able to afford most if not all things that I buy, but sometimes I just can't stomach the financial hit and opt to finance it instead. For example, I recently did this with an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil because there are no fees. (So really I'm not losing anything)  (please point out any logical fallacies if there are any)

I wouldn't do this if it wasn't 0% interest, but I wish I could apply this to other things.

Are there other cards that let you do this? I heard about the Amex Pay It / Plan It, Apple Card (with Apple Products), and the Amazon Card (only on Amazon) but that's about all.

(Just wanted to add, I always have the entire amount of the transaction at the time of purchase/finance)

CreditCards,"Saw a DOC post about the United Explorer card a little while ago. It's a solid offer especially with the extra 2500 miles thrown in. Details are on the DOC post.

I can't apply since I already did back in January. My brother on the other hand just closed his account back in March since he didn't want to renew the annual fee.

He's nowhere close to 5/24 so that isn't an issue. However, he got his first bonus for the same card in October 2018 for the old 40k mile offer. Would he be rejected? I don't know how strict chase is about the 2 year rule.

Anyone have any experience with this or another chase card with a similar scenario.

Thanks for the help."

CreditCards,"Hello, 

So I had this debt that I was unaware of. I did not return a text book from college, I was charged about $350, which was eventually bought by some debt collector company. I checked my credit score about a year ago and found out about this debt and paid it off right then. So I had a credit score of about 500, which is not great. So that explained why I was always denied when applying for a credit score. 

So here is where I need advice, how do I know get approved for a credit score? I waited about 5 months after paying off the debt, but when I applied I was denied again because of no credit history. How do I build a credit history? Is there a way to get a credit card through my parents? and If I can do that, would that technically build my credit? 

tldr: How do I build credit if I can't get a credit card?"

CreditCards,"Little bit of background. I'm a Risk Analyst at one of the top 10 US credit card companies, with about 7 years of experience. I close down credit cards that have the risk of being Bust Out, Synthetic, Pollinator and Scam. We usually do so without telling you before hand and you get a letter/email/phone call after it has happened. I'm going to post some examples of what NOT to do with your credit cards.

Okay, so this one is more about what we did NOT see. Also this example might be a ""No duh!"" type example, but it's more for people that are new to credit, have damaged credit, or no credit.

This account was open very recently and we closed it less than a week after it was open.

Single Credit Card: Open in July 2020.

We closed it for,

1. Lack of credit information
2. Credit not deep enough

To be honest these are our bullshit closures. When nothing else fits, we use these two. Also they pretty much mean the same thing, the wording is a little bit different.

Now, I hate these type of accounts, I hate closing them and I hate telling the customer why they are closed, because at times I feel like a idiot. This account should have never been open in the first place, yet due to someone in the Lending or Verification department not taking the time to review the credit card application in detail, it gets passed to us to close it less than a week after it was open. We are basically the hatchet men for these types of accounts and it's one of the few things about this job that I absolutely despise.

Now lets get to the reason why we closed it.

Year of birth: 1981

Experian: Empty

TransUnion: Empty

Equifax: Something

Right away we have a red flag. Two of the three bureau's not reporting anything? Not a single inquiry, account, collections, not even the months on file?

This is what we have on the Equifax.

On-file date: 2013

10 inquiries in the past 24 months, all spread out, all for telephone companies

One collection for a telephone company, that was pretty recent.

A utility trade line from 2012, that was also in collections.

And that's it.

Just from this, this person should never have gotten a credit card. As far as we can tell, they never had any sort of credit in their life, even though they were eligible for credit around the year 2000. Social Security Card was also issued in the 80's.

And that's it! A very simple closure, for a credit card that should have never gone past the application phase.

My advice for anyone in a similar situation? Get yourself a secured credit card.

Random google search: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/secured](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/secured)

It's a type of credit card for people with limited or damaged credit that requires the user to place a refundable security deposit ($500), which the car's issuer holds as collateral until the account is closed.

It's not going to be as nice as a fancy Chase, Discover or American Express card, but it's the best way to start building/rebuilding your credit. Don't rush, pay on time, maybe get another card a year until you have 3 credit cards with regular activity. It's going to take time."

CreditCards,"New to reddit and churning, I'm looking into starting my journey with Amex because Chase is being difficult with approvals especially now due to the Rona. I have a few questions: 

**Credit score:** 751 

**Number of cards:** 1 BOA cash back card (currently 0/24 b/c that card opened 4 years ago)

**Number of cards applied for within past year:** 2 (Chase Freedom and Amex BCE) and denied for both in January (didn't realize I had an account payable and was an authorized user on cards hurting my utilization, I have since taken care of both) 

1) Is all hope lost for Chase and is it worth it to try for the Chase Freedom or go with Amex because I'm being targeted for the gold card 75k point offer. Also note, I have a recent student loan account that's 11 months old, which I heard with Chase you should wait 13 months after opening new accounts.

2) Are SUBs available for each card when you sign up? For example, if I start with the Everyday Card, will I still receive the SUB for the Gold card after waiting 6 months when I sign up (not upgrade). I understand that it varies based on if you've closed/opened but that doesn't apply to me since I'm new and I'm confused by the 'Once in a Lifetime' phrasing

3)  Does the same apply for SUBs for Amex Business? I have an online retailing business and would like to start with BBP now and file for a Business Gold in a few months when I know I'll be spending more on ads

CreditCards,"Hi all, not sure if this has ever happened to anyone but this is the first time that my score has gone up after a new account got reported.

I opened the Chase Freedom on 7/23 ($1000 CL) but it finally got reported to my EX today (8/19/20) and my score went up 42 points. Utilization went from 7% to 6% and everything else stayed the same so I am thinking that this was the main reason my score went up. Also, my EX score updates daily and there was no other notification or alert so this must be it. It’s just strange that it went up that much because my score usually goes down whenever there is a new account opened. I am just wondering if this has ever happened to anyone? 

Also, unlike CK, EX doesn’t really tell me what causes the change in the score, just the “You Have 1 New Account.”"

CreditCards,"Seriously, why does it matter at all? It’s 30% of your score too! 

I thought the point of a credit score was to show lenders how good you are at repaying your debts. But if your limit is $3000 and you spend $1500 on your credit card and pay it all back in full and on time, your score will go down. How does this make sense?

Apparently the ideal amount of credit utilization is 1-10%, and anything above 30% starts to hurt your score. How does it make sense that spending $30 on your $3k limit shows better financial security than spending $1000 and paying it all back on time?"

CreditCards,"**My spending behavior:** Grocery, rent, and student loan repayment will cover most of my monthly and annual expenses. I plan on using cc only for grocery (~$400 monthly) and other small things (~$200 for perhaps public transportation and charity). Don’t really have other expenses currently. I’ve always been frugal but with a central priority to my happiness and core values.

**CC preference:** No AF. I know a bit more about cash backs than rewards, so my preference lies there. However, I’m open to considering cc options with great rewards program. Don’t know any other aspects of cc. I looked at several posts, and they can get quite overwhelming with the various options. I saw Citi, Amex, and Chase mentioned a lot. I also read stories where people missed one payment in the beginning of a new year, but the interest accrued accounted for that whole year or so. I don’t want to fall into those traps, so please let me know what caveats I should look for.

**Bank history:** Got a card (idk what kind...probably debit) from parent when I was younger. Hardly ever used it because I’m not much of a spender unless necessary (somehow developed a cc and dc anxiety out of this 🤡). Anyway, I recently found a steady income and opened a checking account with Ally (a savings account soon too). I’m not looking to open any extra checking accounts, at least for the time being.

*Future goals:* Primarily looking into traveling more and eating out more in a couple years. Will keep this in mind when considering reward points. :)"
CreditCards,"Hi all,

I recently applied for the Wells Fargo Propel Card, aiming for those nice category cash backs, and was promptly denied. Their reasoning was (and I'm paraphrasing, as I can't recall the exact wordage) 1)poor payment history 2)high balances 3)recent credit activity. I asked for a reconsideration, as only the last was true (I'd applied for the CF last month, my last inquires before then was back in March). The underwriter still rejected me though, unfortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, when should I consider reapplying? I imagine the first route would be to wait a few months, but I was wondering how long exactly. The lady mentioned something about this account application being active for 60 days, and I wasn't 100% sure what she'd meant. Couldn't ask to elaborate because I had to run, sadly. TIA!"
CreditCards,Is this card still an active downgrade option?
CreditCards,"Hello there, 
I am a sucker for cashback and rewards. I am thinking to close my chase sapphire preferred before Oct 31 so I don’t have to pay 95 in AF (I am open to change my decision if convinced). I like the 25% incentive on UR points but I don’t think 95 USD is worth because
  - I find cheap tickets on Frontier, Spirit and momondo.com which easily beats Expedia that powers chase portal. I have TSA precheck and unlimited bags due to military
  - I am not interested in staying at Hilton/Marriot by booking a 100 USD room in 50 USD worth of UR as I have friends that can get me cheap discount on Wyndham and Choice hotels. I usually don’t travel much as well. This could change in future as I am single atm

  - I don’t think I can find more people to refer and earn referral bonus, lol
 Referred 3 or 4 in around 3 years

  - I am primarily looking for a higher cashback credit card on groceries which is my max spending category. Currently my rewards are as follows
   Travel, Restaurants - 4% thru Costco
   Gas - 5% thru Amex USAA
   Everything else - Chase (1.25% thru UR barring limited promo offers)- Driver Card
   BoFA- rarely used
       


Current cards: (list cards, limits, opening date)
 BoFA Cashback (with 3% category: Online shopping) - rarely used
 CSP (Maxed out Pay Yourself back by redeeming 1.25 X in credit card statements) , AF - 95 USD
 Costco Citi AF- 120 including membership
 USAA - For Gas and PX shopping, Af - 0

FICO Score: e.g. &gt; 760

Oldest account age: e.g. 6 years 8 months

Income: e.g. &gt; $100K

Average monthly spend and categories:
 dining $150-200
 groceries: $500-$600
 gas: $30
 other: $200-300

Open to Business Cards: No

What’s the purpose of your next card? Max Out grocery cashback - Mostly I do grocery shopping at HEB, Costco and Indian Stores

Do you have any cards you’ve been looking at? Looked Amex Blue Cash Preferred and Everyday. Preferred might make more sense at 6% cashback and $95 AF vs 3% cashback and 0 AF. Both are capped at 6000K worth of grocery shopping per year
 
Any advice is welcome if somebody thinks they have a better combo than me, please share"
CreditCards,Got the sign-up bonuses for CFU and CF just sitting but am waiting for an increased offer for the CSP so I can put UR points towards transfer partners.
CreditCards,"So my PayPal Cashback card’s due date was on Aug 2, and on that day I paid the entire current balance, in the app, of about $160. Immediately after, I realized that I actually needed the payment to come from a different bank account, so I tapped on the option to modify the payment, selected the correct bank, and got an email confirmation about it going through. A few days later, I noticed that the payment still hadn’t pulled from my bank, and the PayPal app was still showing my due date as Aug 2, with the same balance.

I called customer service and confirmed that my payment was showing, but some glitch was preventing it from actually posting properly right now. Also confirmed that the payment was definitely on time, for the whole balance, and that it wouldn’t reflect as a missed payment or have any interest charged. Was told I didn’t need to do anything on my end.

Several more days go by, and still the payment hasn’t pulled from my bank. However now I have new post-statement activity in the app, showing first that some interest actually was charged, but then a credit of that exact amount was applied afterwards (I guess this was their solution?), and also it does show that correct payment amount being applied.

As of today, this is still where I stand. I double-checked and my current balance on the card does seem to reflect that payment going through. I also triple-checked both bank accounts in question, and 100% confirmed that no payment was ever actually pulled from either of them. Is it really possible that I got a free $160 out of PayPal’s glitch, and/or CSR incompetence? My main concern is that the payment is suddenly going to be pulled out of nowhere, potentially overdrawing my account. I’ve been keeping at least that amount in there just in case, but I’d rather not have to worry about it. 

I tried to make this all as clear as possible. Please let me know if any clarification is needed, and thanks in advance for any advice!"
CreditCards,"I'm looking for my first credit card to take advantage of cash back as early as I can. I'm a recent graduate, have no debts or loans, and will be starting a full-time job next week at $70k/year. One thing I'd like is minimum no no foreign transaction fees as I will be working 6 months in Germany at sometime in the next two years. 

I was a cardholder on my parent's account in the past, and my FICO score is 730. On monthly spending: groceries/food, $300; pet fees, $65; gas, $100; phone, $75. No rent. I'm planning to purchase a car in the coming weeks with a max monthly fee of $600 including insurance. 

I care more about cash back than rewards at the moment, although I am open to cards with notable rewards. Any recommendations?

Edit: also to note, I’d prefer no AF if possible, and do not have any interest in opening a new checking account"
CreditCards,"So.. 
my cc got charged off in nov 2019
I tried contacting the agency to resolve my debt, they have no record of me. They advised to call citi bank they have no more record of the account since it’s been sold. This agency has attempted every which way to find my account by using my account # which i don’t have anymore or the card. I have moved since opening that card some time ago and always had things sent electronically so i have no way of finding the account number. I spoke with many managers in both citi bank and Calvary collections and to no avail. They literally told me they have never seen this and don’t know what to do. I’m going to search again for the card or some sort of paper which they both recommend i do at this point even tho i know I’m pretty sure i won’t find anything for how i keep things.. and i cut up the card and threw it away so i wouldn’t spend anymore i know dumb mistake..


Any ideas?

Thanks in advance"
CreditCards,"I ordered something a while ago and I returned the item. My billing cycle just ended yesterday with a statement balance of $200. The refund is $100.

Today I check my account and it says my current balance is $100 (I’m guessing $100 refund was successful) but the problem is my available balance is still $800 even though the refund came. Is this normal? Is it a glitch? Do you think it’ll get fixed? This is my first credit card and first refund to a credit card"

CreditCards,"I was approved for AMEX Gold this weekend. I saw the post on this board about the 75k SUB, but I only saw 60k when checking their page. But I tried the Amex pre-qualified tool over a few days and finally got an offer for 75k. I took the offer and was subsequently approved. In my delirium, I think I even saw a $300 credit in the offer (not including the travel expense credit, and food credit). I considered taking a picture of the offer, but for some ungodly reason I decided against it.

I have since received my card with all its documentation, logged in to my account and confirmed my card, but I can't see any information about the SUB.

I find this weird as with Chase the SUB had a very visible tracker, and it was easy to track progress. Is there really no easy way to see SUB with Amex? I have chatted with AMEX live chat and they say I have to ask them once my account updates."
CreditCards,"Need help, found fraud charges on cards multiple times from suspected friend. Fairly certain I know who it is. Totals over 2k, what would you do?"
CreditCards,"800+ Fico. I have two small business w/ Chase, and multiple CC pooling to my CSR. 

Last two cards I applied for , got denied, Freedom and Freedom Unlimited. I ended up simply calling them, and shifting personal credit around. 

I inquired why I kept getting denied. They told me I had reached my credit limit with them, that they look at the business cards as well. Issue is that my business cards have an excessive amount of credit. It's fine, glad to have it, but not sure how to boost my credit personal limit with Chase. 

Is this just a waiting game?"
CreditCards,"Hey everyone,

I'm relatively new to the credit card game, I have one card (the Capital One Platinum) which I've had for 11 months. They gave me a credit limit of $300 and then increased it to $500. My score is currently 711. My question is, which card should I apply for next? I really want to get an Amex card but I don't know if I would qualify or which card to get. Should I wait for my score to go up more or is it okay to apply now? I've been looking at the Amex Everyday card or the Amex Blue Business Plus card (I'm trying to avoid an annual fee card)."
CreditCards,we just got home from a trip and noticed a few things in our bag were damaged. I was gonna file a claim with chase but I see it says you need to talk to the common carrier immediately. Is it too late to talk to them since we already left the airport or can I call and file a claim.

Average age of credit is only 10mo because I recently opened two new cards (both in May of this year). 

I spend most of my money on groceries, take out restaurants, Amazon, and gas. 

I thought about the Capital One Savor but don’t like my approval odds. I’d also prefer a card with no annual fee but I’m willing to get one with a $95 fee if it’s the right card and/or has a good SUB. 

Mostly I want a new card so that I have another open account since I only have 3. Just want something I have good approval odds for and I might get something out of.  

Let me know if you need more info! Thank you in advance."

Not open to business cards. I’m currently a college student and would like something without a foreign transaction fee for future study abroad opportunities and maybeeee a travel rewards card. The only traveling I really do is to visit relatives in Korea so my dreams were crushed when Korean Air got removed as an ultimate rewards transfer partner. I’m looking at Marriott Bonvoy for Korean Air but not sure how worth it it would be. 

Also recently got denied for Wells Fargo Propel for having too many inquiries on my account (3 within the last two years including the one Wells Fargo pulled:/ ). Currently looking at CapitalOne quicksilver or a BECU card for no FTF but not sure if I really need these with the cards I currently have. I’m also looking at Citi Double Cash but I don’t think I would qualify with my current FICO. The Wells Fargo denial letter reported my FICO score as 747. The only bank I have a prior relationship is Bank of America. Thank you in advance!"
CreditCards,"Hi there! I have several cards that I keep open for the credit usage and credit history factors, but also have the Chase United Mileage that has a $95 fee and I don't see the benefit of the rewards anymore. While I'm inclined to close the card, I'd also be losing 26k+ in ""availability"" that will throw off my score due to credit usage adjustments. I'm at 824 score (mint reporting, I know it's likely a bit lower) currently, so there is wiggle room.

Should I keep it open for the balance or is it likely I could get a large enough increase on another card to match the loss? Other factors or advice?

Update: Thanks for the info/suggestions. I called today and they offered a statement credit to offset the fee and it shouldn't impact my future goals of the Sapphire again. "

CreditCards,"I opened a Rakuten credit card that’s under Synchrony Bank in Nov 2019. I never activated it and used it so my balance was $0. I also can’t log into the online account site so I am restricted in seeing past info and account activity. 

I called customer service in Jan 2020 to close it and I thought it was closed. My mint account shows me that it was closed but I’m not sure how accurate that is. However I noticed that there is a second Rakuten credit card account open which I did not consent to or know about. I also never received the cards for this other account. On my Rakuten shopping ebates online account (not the credit card bank account), it shows both cards as active and linked to my account which I was shocked to see. 

So not only did they not close my original account, they kept it open and opened another account??!! I’m not sure if this is even legal or how it’s possible.

It was one of the first cards I got in 2012 (8 years) but I honestly don't use it anymore and the majority of my cards are with Chase (this is a Cap1 card). A $5K limit really isn't anything and I'm half worried that my score will drop now (my total borrowing amount will go from around $55K to $49K). 

Does it make sense to keep this card open even with the lower limit? It's a no fee credit card. Or should I close it and maybe open up another card with Chase (if I even wanted to) to close the gap? Current credit score is 802."

CreditCards,"Just got the CSR a couple weeks ago and with groceries and gas purchases I’ve already hit the $300 mark. But I stoped getting the credits after getting 278.48 back from a grocery store visit and getting gas. Those two credits came up right away after posting  as TRAVEL CREDIT $300/YEAR. 

I’ve made other gas/grocery purchases that have posted and haven’t gotten a credit yet. Is this normal for the credit to sometimes take a while? 



Side note: I know this isn’t a big deal but a little disappointed with how the card arrived, just in a envelope expected a little box or nice mailer. Maybe it’s because I requested the card to be expedited. Again, not a real problem just surprised."

CreditCards,"Hi all! 

I heard all the buzz about the Amex Gold's 60K offer so I decided to check out the prequalify tool and to my surprise, I got a 75K offer!

I've been a loyal Chase user so this would be my first Amex card. I had no intentions of getting a new card, but this offer seems too good to be true. What would you do in my situation?

My current main drivers:

* CSR / CIC / CIP
* Chase Amazon Prime

I'm 1/24 right now and recently got the CIP about 7 months ago. FICO score above 760. 4 hard inquiries and the next one won't expire til mid next year.

My next move was going to be the CFU for effectively 7.5% groceries and then the CIC (when Chase is less stringent about sole proprietors). The Amex Gold would suit my grocery needs, but I'm really just after that sign-up bonus. Unless they give me a good retention offer, I'm not sure I want to continue to hold onto the card when I'm already vested in the Chase ecosystem. What would be my downgrade options for the Gold?

Should I take advantage of this offer now? Thanks in advance!"

CreditCards,"I need to book a domestic flight from San Francisco, California to Dallas, Texas and I currently have 150k UR points on a Chase Ink Business Preferred. I haven't used credit card points for travel before and I'm not sure whether I should use the Chase Travel Portal for what I think would be 1.25 cpp or if I should use a Chase Transfer Partner instead. Also, I'm flying coach and only myself.

CreditCards,"I just got into the credit card game this year, I travel internationally 2-3 times/year (pre-covid 😂) and liked the idea of saving $, flying business/first, lounge access etc. 

I got the discover IT secured on 2/10/20 as I had no credit history. Only put $200 on it. 

I knew I wanted to start down the chase pathway but had no relationship with them. 

In late April I opened up an investment account w/ chase and put like $2k into an index fund and waited. I would’ve done the checking account but I didn’t want to mess with fees. Also I plan on closing this soon and combining it with the rest of my portfolio w/ Schwab.

Anyway, I applied today and got an instant approval! My credit limit is only $1500 but I can work with that. 

To end with a question,
how long should I wait to apply for the CFU?"
CreditCards,"
hey guys

so i ordered an imac from best buy. i’m in medical school and all our classes are online now and my laptop is broken. paid damn near $2200 for this computer. 

8/11 it was scheduled for delivery. it said i need a signature, so i intentionally didn’t sign because i wasn’t home that day and didn’t want it left out. for some reason it delivered. 1st floor of an apartment complex

i call best buy when i get home 8 hours later because there’s no package outside. they start an investigation. the reps are clueless. the first guy i talked to said hes issuing me a refund right then and there (totally wrong, they have to do an investigation first)

anyhow, after many many calls to best buy, i got an email on 8/16 saying they won’t refund or replace the item. talk to ups or law enforcement. 

well, i talked to ups 8/14, 3 days after calling best buy. UPS said the imac tracking number has no investigation open and only the shipper can file a claim. i called today, 8/17, and they still said no claim was open on this tracking number. they also said no signature confirmation was requested for this package which best buy confirmed (but when i signed into ups mychoice it said sig required?? it says that for all my packages idk why) 
they said they’re not asking for signature require due to COVID. thats absolutely bs to not let your customers know that because i would have done in store pickup if that was the case. 

law enforcement isn’t an option bc i dont know what happened to the package. so i filed a dispute with my bank (visa wells fargo) for a chargeback. what are my chances? 

i’m freaking out bc i cannot afford a $2200 loss. like not figuratively i cannot afford it, like literally i won’t be able to pay rent or i won’t be able to buy a computer which is absolutely vital to me right now. 

i dont feel like this was my fault. i know no one can help if it was stolen, but how the hell do you ship a $2200 computer without signature confirmation????? 

what are my chances of winning this chargeback y’all please anyone who’s had similar cases help

*edit* so i checked my email and THANKFULLY, i have a UPS my choice email saying a signature is REQUIRED for this package. no signature was given, thus the delivery was not completed, correct? i’m not an asshole, i just knew ups policy is to redeliver when a signature cannot be acquired, i never once thought that they would leave it there without one

*edit 2* so i’m an idiot. my neighbor brought in the package because he “didn’t want someone to steal it”. he’s a sweet old man and he’s a bit senile. he said it slipped his mind to let me know he brought it in and apologized profusely. i just thanked him for doing that, didn’t feel the need to let him know how much of a headache it caused me. the package was like 30 pounds so the fact that this cute old man who walks with a cane dragged it into his place is so so nice of him. 
i canceled the dispute with my bank and told best buy i found the package and i returned it to best buy bc honestly fuck them and their shitty ass response to my missing package and not having a signature required for a $2200 package. never buying from this piece of shit company again. 
although for those who are reading this who are in a similar situation, wells fargo told me on 4 different occasions we basically would win the case. a no signature ups “proof of delivery” does not suffice as actual proof of delivery. so again, fuck you best buy. learn how to run a corporation you pieces of shit. and no, i’m not salty bc my neighbor took it, i’m salty bc best buy conducted an “investigation” without ever reaching out to ups. they didn’t even do the bare minimum and were okay with letting me take a $2200 loss. but all is well now"

CreditCards,"I have had a Bank of America bank account for over a year which has been direct deposited to and used many times over for many transactions to buy things or send money to friends. 

I applied for a BOA Cash Rewards Student card and got approved while my Discover application has been pre-approved.

Would it be smart to alternate payments on the Discover It student Cashback card and the BOA CRS (by keeping in mind which Cashback is higher as well) so I have two lines of credit that have the same AAoA, boosting my credit score faster?

Thanks"
CreditCards,"What are people's thoughts on the Propel? I think it has a good all-around rewards program on day to day categories. This is my first rewards card ever, so I'm excited to try it out. Not sure if I made the right choice though, I was between the Altitude GO, Chase Freedom, Citi Double Cash Card, and the Discover it. 

My only worry is that the card is an AMEX and not a VISA or MASTERCARD. I'm currently in the US, and yes most places do take AMEX, but abroad, although still pretty common, I've come across places that don't take it."

Its been 3 weeks since, and ive talked to discover twice and they said its still not been checked. 
They are saying its due to COVID19, the IRS cant work fast enough i guess.

CreditCards,"I was recently denied on an application for a Citibank premium travel co-branded card (Citi Expedia). I was told I had insufficient positive credit history. Calling the reconsideration line and talking to agents who went through the application reconfirmed that this was the case and it could not be reversed at this time.

It was a bit of a shock, as I have an 800 plus credit score with all the bureaus, three credit cards across Bank of America and Chase with utilization currently close to zero, and across the three nearly $65,000 in credit line. One is the Chase Sapphire Reserve. I have not opened a new card in two years and have only opened three cards in 10 years total.

I will not be taking out any loans on anything anytime soon. My mortgage and car are paid off.  Credit cards would be the most practical way for me to increase My credit history.

Or? What will be the best way for me to build enough of whatever Citi is looking for to be able to be approved for any of their higher end hotel/airline co-branded cards?

If I do go the credit card route, what would be the best strategy? I already know I can get approved immediately for any Chase card, but would it be more advantageous in terms of building positive credit history to get the card from a different issuer like Bank of America, Amex, Wells Fargo, etc rather than have many cards under what issuer (Chase)? Or would Citi not really care based on their criteria? Thanks"

CreditCards,"Hey guys!

I’m not very knowledgeable when it comes to credit cards at all, in fact I’m 32 and I just got my first secured cc (Discovery It) a month ago, I’ve always exclusively used my debit or cash for payments (I was brought up with the idea that if I wanted something, I saved up for it).

So, let’s say I buy food for $30, it clears, I pay it off days later. Do this a few times a month and when the billing period ends my balance is $0.

Is it okay for me to pay off a balance right after it clears? Or should I want until it’s near 30% utilization before I pay it off in full? And keeping my balance $0 before the cycle ends?

Basically

Will the cc company see that as inactive?

Thanks for the help!"

I’m extremely frugal and I am looking for a card that gets me the absolute best value. I have absolutely no problem flying southwest because generally I’ve found them to be the cheapest airline by far. I’m sure the points redemption rates are better on some of the other cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, etc than they are on one of the Southwest Premier/Plus/Priority cards but I guess I’m just lost with how much info there is, each company has their own reward systems, etc.

TL;DR: I’m looking for a card that will let my fly and travel by maximizing the amount of points I can get and spending the least amount of money (which probably means southwest which is fine). Special boarding pass perks, etc. are not necessarily of interest to me as I’m super frugal! FICO score is 752."

CreditCards,"Hey guys, first post here and I'm looking for advice on my 2nd credit card choice. I've had a checking account with Chase since I was 16 and finally got the Chase Freedom card in December of 2018. My parents always warned me about getting a credit card when I was young so it took me a while to realize all the benefits and get one for myself. Anyway, I've been using the card over the past year and a half and have been making use of the rotating 5% CB categories when possible. I've never missed a payment and I recently financed a used car where I saw my FICO score was about 750 between the 3 credit agencies. I decided to apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited to make use of the signing bonus and continue my progress of completing the traditional Chase Trifecta. Though my Chase account said I was already approved for this card, I was denied the next day despite listing my salary at 60K (what I get yearly from loans and what my salary will be as a resident physician).

I should mention that I am currently a 4th year medical student so I don't have any income other than what I get from my student loans, and my total student loan balance is above 300K at the moment. The only other debt I have is my car which is about 15K...I have the money to pay it off but I wanted to keep my monthly payments since I was told having some installment accounts open will boost credit score over the long term. Anyway, my question is should I wait and apply again for the Chase Freedom Unlimited in a few months, try for another card like the Citibank Double Cash and forget about the Trifecta, or just wait a few years altogether until I make my full salary as an attending physician? My goal is to accumulate points while boosting my credit score since I hope to refinance my student loans at some point and want a low interest rate. I don't do much travel yet but hope to in a couple years. Thanks in advance for the help!"

There’s probably anywhere from 20-40k/month of expenses we could be charging on a credit card to get points back, but no one has set that up yet. So I guess my question is, what would be the most ideal way to harvest points off that 20-40k/month?

—————————


We use “Commute with Enterprise” at work. It’s a carpool program that (in our case) is reimbursed in full every month. 1 hour drive to work, 1 hour back. 


Here’s a quick breakdown. Each van has 6-7 riders and a coordinator who pays for the van and fuel every month, $985 for the van, about $200-300 for fuel. Some coordinators deal in cash and prepaid gas cards but that doesn’t leave for much accountability imo. Add in lost cards and rollover balance it it gets hairy. Most coordinators, myself included, use a credit/debit card to pay the van in full at the beginning of the month and the same card is used to fuel the van every few days. I collect all receipts and payment info at the end of each month, scan them to .pdf, add up the total and divide by 7 (total riders in the van so we all pay the same), email each rider the info, then we each individually do the online voucher. Once I send out the email, my riders send me that amount to my personal account. 


A few years ago, I started using my Chase Freedom card because for 3 months out of the year, it would have 5% cash back on fuel. Awhile later I got a BoA Travel Rewards card that offered the same 5% on fuel but different months. Example, Jan-March I’d use the chase card for 5% back, then April-June I’d swap out the card for the BoA to get that 5% back. The other half of the year it would only be 1%. I was fine with that but the BoA 5% cash back seems to have vanished so I’m down to 5% back on fuel for only 3 months out of the year. 


How can I maximize potential points/cash back/miles? My score is 812 (820 last month) experian, 845 TU, not sure on the third. 0 late payments and I pay off all balances in full. I’m thinking about canceling the BoA card (side question, if paid off and no bad marks or balance, does it hurt anything to cancel a credit card after a few years?) and replacing it with something better suited to this scenario. I’ve had the chase card a lot longer and it still does the 5%, should I upgrade to sapphire or something? I’m fine with whatever rewards I can get, my wife and I do travel overseas every couple years but whatever has the best bang for the buck. 


**TD;DR:** I spend around $1,200 or so a month, every month, on vehicle rental and gas. What credit card can I use to take advantage of this to maximize points/cash back/miles?

**EDIT:** Not sure if it makes a difference but I have Wells Fargo as my main bank (and debit card I rarely use) but none of their credit cards look too attractive unless there’s some super secret society card I have to perform some ritual to get."

CreditCards,"So to try to make a long story short, I'm planning to buy a new laptop for around $1700 with taxes and was going to put about half down and half on credit. The store that has it for sale, though, doesn't accept PayPal credit which I already have, so I had open a new credit card. I didn't mind as I've actually never had one (other than PayPal credit) and all of my credit reports suggest I could benefit from using one some.

So I went through a list looking at possible options and wanted to go for the Amex Everyday Card, but their website said I didn't pre-qualify even though my fico score hovers around 750. So because of this, I went through with another card - the US Bank Platinum Visa that has the initial 20 months of 0% APR - which still doesn't seem to be too bad.

I've done a little looking and it seems that my fico score would've actually qualified for the Amex Everyday card and likely would've been approved for it if I had applied. I would've preferred to go for that card, especially as they'll provide instant credit access which is kinda what I'm looking for.

Is there anything I can do to undo/cancel the application with US Bank and apply for the card with Amex? I applied for US Bank about 10pm last night, but I have already received a notice that they did an inquiry on my credit. So if I cancel now will it hurt my credit?"

CreditCards,"Hello everyone,

my brother has a high credit score of 740-750 but only has 2 credit cards with low credit  limits of 3,000 on both cards. My question is, what steps can he take to use his cards to  its full potential and take the advantage of having a high credit score and how can he drastically raise his limits?

Also best Credit cards will accept him with his score?"
CreditCards,"I hope this DP helps many of you looking to get your first Chase card. So I received my first credit card on August of 2019 and I went ahead and applied for the CFU once August 2020 hit.

CreditCards,"Hello folks, I could really use some advice.

My husband is in the army and we were transferred right in the beginning of March when COVID started from Georgia to Hawaii. 

I had a job lined up 3 months before arrival but because of Covid it fell through as child care centers here are not taking on any new clients due to Covid so we have no one to care for our one year old. 



That being said, things are tight but we still have the finances to make all payments which we have been doing. The only change has been we finally switched our bank account to Navy Fed (if any of my military readers are familiar with this bank).


From years before I met my husband when my finances were not capable of covering my everyday needs (groceries, gas etc) I have two card with a bank called Credit One. 

Well now apparently I have ONE. 
They have CLOSED one of my cards. I missed ONE payment not because we didn’t have the money but because when I logged in to pay it was refusing to process and the payment was due on a Friday and we are 6 hours behind the mainland here so by the time I called customer service they were closed.

Regardless of that attempt, this crappy banks customer service options are extremely limited to the point that I was actually calling customer service without my issue actually being an option to speak to an operator. They really try to screw you by making all serious issues ONLY CONTACTABLE BY MAIL. 

So at this point I need advice on what to do. This TANKED my credit score 40 points, and on the app or directly on the site the card is basically nonexistent so I can’t even make payments to correct the issue. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated"

CreditCards,"Hello! My (24F) first post here, looking for some advice. I've had my CSP since Nov 2018 and got the 65k SUB Feb 2019. I initially got it for the SUB and no FTF for my international trip last year. Since then I have mainly been using it for dining, but recently I hardly spend on that. I am thinking to downgrade it since the $95 AF probably doesnt make sense right now for my low spend and I won't be planning any travel anytime soon due to covid. I'm on the fence because if I'm able to travel next year (covid willing), I wouldn't be able to transfer points to travel partners or even have the added redemption bonus through the UR Travel portal. I have 95k UR pts right now.

Does it make more sense to downgrade CSP or suck up the AF for now in hopes I can redeem my UR points at higher value for travel next year? The AF will hit again this December. If I downgrade, I'm thinking of getting CS to keep the 2x dining with no AF because I don't have a card with dining rewards. If I go this route I would later downgrade CS to CF 6 months before I'm eligible to apply for another Sapphire SUB (not eligible until 2023). I always see comments saying downgrading to CS never seems worth it. I don't think I'd ever get close to maxing the $1500 quarterly max spend on CF's 5% categories so I don't think I necessarily need a 2nd CF. Or should I downgrade to a 2nd CF anyway, and if I really wanted dining rewards, maybe apply for US Bank Altitude Go for 4x on dining (or any other no AF CC with dining rewards). Added note, I just opened the CF this month for the SUB, so I think I should wait a few months before I try to apply for another card (especially if applying for US bank b/c I have no existing relationship).

I'm particularly but not exclusively concerned with the cell phone insurance.

Also, if anyone has experience with World and World Elite benefits, like Priceless golf, are they actually worth getting a MasterCard for. I'm looking for a new card, and if the MasterCard benefits are really as good as they seem, it feels like it's worth it to limit my search to MasterCards."
CreditCards,"Hi guys,

I am confused about when to pay my credit card bill to optimize my score.

My due date is always on the 16th, but my statement date is different every month, usually somewhere between the 19-21st.  I’ve noticed that what affects the credit score is whatever the balance is on the statement date.  This month, my statement is on the 21st.

I always pay my credit card in full every month.  Last month, I paid in full on the due date of the 16th, however, by the time the statement date rolled around (I think on the 21st), I had already spent $500 more, and it made my credit score go down because the utilization was too high! Shouldn’t I be rewarded with an addition of points if I paid on my due date?

My question is: when do I pay to optimize my score and have my utilization close to 0% on the statement date? This month, I plan on skipping the due date and waiting till the 20th to pay everything off, so by the 21st, the utilization will be close to 0%, making my score go up.  But in afraid if I skip the due date of the 16th, I will get punished for it.  I also don’t want to have to pay more than once a month because that is tedious and annoying.

What should I do?

Thanks"

However, in June I was denied for a card for US Bank. The reasoning for denial was that I had applied for too many cards too frequently, this was the first card I had applied for in 5 or 6 months so I was surprised. I ran a credit report yesterday through Equifax and I have zero hard inquiries on file and my report looks fine. I am most likely going to be applying for a CSR for my next card as I want to get a card with good points/rewards for dining. I’m worried this might look bad for my account if I get denied again, but based on my credit report it is throwing me off and I’m thinking I should apply. I’ve also heard that Chase is more strict with accepting people at the moment due to the Covid situation.

My FICO score came out last month, it's 710. I want a credit limit increase now and hope to apply for Chase unlimited in 2021. How much increase should I ask for. Would $800/$900/$1000 be too much or low?

I did requested a credit limit increase 3-ish months ago, but BoA denied it because I hadn't had the card long enough. Would it be fine for me to ask for it now? Also, my paycheck goes directly to my BoA checking account, if that helps.

I opened a Chase checking account on July 15th, moved a few thousand into there, and have made at least 10 transactions on it in that time, so maybe that will be enough to waive the 12 months anyway?

CreditCards,"So after a few weeks of planning this, I finally decided to take a personal loan from Payoff. For those not familiar, this is basically a loan given for the purpose of wiping out all cc debt, and then paying back that loan rather than the individual cc's.

So this is what I did. Wiped off about 15k cc debt, and now have a 15k personal loan, that I pay monthly. 

After paying the first month, my credit score.shot up 100 points. The report shows me having accrued no larger ""personal loan"" balance, while my current ""credit card"" balances have dropped, as I paid them all off last month. 

Am I just awaiting for the transaction to clear and for the personal loan $$ increase, or is my credit score really 100 points hire for just swapping debt types -- cc for personal loan?"
CreditCards,"Hi, I applied CFU on 7/27 and got the request for verifying SSN. Mine has ""valid for work only with DHS authorization"" on it, so it failed (Specifically, I got a notice in my Chase portal saying “ We carefully reviewed the documents you sent us about the application listed above. Unfortunately, they didnot provide the information required and we are unable to process your application. "" on 8/9). When I called on 8/10, the agent told me my application is closed because I submitted materials (SS card, SSA-89 form) more than twice. I haven't got a mailed denial yet, and 877-260-0087 showed the status is ""7-10 days"".

Now I got a pre-selected mail offer for CFU. It asks me to go to [Getfreedomunlimited.com](https://Getfreedomunlimited.com) and attaches an invitation number. And it says ""15-second decision"". I didn't find any pre-qualified offer in my Chase portal, so I am assuming ""pre-selected"" is different from ""pre-qualified"". The expiration date of the offer is 9/28.

My profile is as follows. The history is 4 year 8 months,  a Chase checking and a Discover credit card. The discover showed my score is 802.

I am wondering shall I wait for the denial to be mailed and call the recon and mention that I have this offer? I don't know whether this is feasible, since the agent I called last time said the application is closed and I can only reapply. To be honest, I am confused since I getting the request for verifying SSN indicates I am not that ""good"" but then why would I got this offer which I am assuming is targeted at ""good"" candidates. The suggestion is welcomed, and thank you very much!"

CreditCards,"So I just tried logging into my account using the Citi app like I've done hundreds of times. I got a message saying I needed to re-enable my fingerprint unlock to use that as a login method. I went to enable it, and it said I need a one-time verification code.

Instead of sending me the code through text or email like literally every other company in the world, the app told me I needed to call into customer service to get the code.

So I called in, got transferred to NINE different people, went through all sorts of verification questions, and the last person told me that I needed to wait 2 weeks and try to enable fingerprint unlock again. What the HELL?!"
CreditCards,I issued a chargeback on my capital one CC for some fraud purchases that were made to some Chinese Company on July 31st. August 4th I got the credit for the charges and that posted.

Hey guys my credit score is around 710. I have had the Chase Freedom card for one year so far with a limit of $500. (It was my first credit card) I make around $86k before taxes. I want to build my credit up to reach the goal of acquiring my first investment property next year. What credit card should I get next?"
CreditCards,"I NEED to rent a car. I do not have a credit card. I live in West Columbia, SC. I have a prepaid booking through Priceline and I have not been assigned a specific rental car company that I will be picking up the car from. I know from past experience that my local airport for some reason is extremely strict about who can use a debit card for a deposit or to even rent a car paying in full. 
      I would consider my self a seasoned veteran when it comes to knowing my way around credit cards, debit cards, and the United States financial system in general. Due solely to my lack of making good choices I ran up lots of credit card debt, and now I am out of having a credit card at all. 
      My question is can any of the US rental car corporations (Focusing on the big 3 Conglomerates/Corporate Giants: Hertz/Dollar/Thrifty, Enterprise/National/Alamo, &amp; last but not least Avis/Budget/Zipcar), tell the actual difference or distinguish whether the payment method that’s being used for a deposit whether or not an actual Credit card vs. a Debit Card? Has anyone ever gotten away with presenting a debit card when they clearly requested a credit card and no issues arise from doing so? The card will have enough to cover the deposit and none of the 4 debit cards I have to choose from are prepaid cards. (SoFi MasterCard with no debit card labels on it, MoneyLion Visa, Roarmoney VISA, and lastly a GreenDot BANK account not prepaid card that could pass for being a Secured GreenDot Credit Card with the debit card marking covered as well. 
     From what I understand every time I would rent a vehicle in the past. They would immediately ask me if I was using a debit card or a credit card. Even with proof of round trip travel, and providing not only all of the requested documents listed on their websites; along with being above the minimum required renters age. They act as if the employee working the rental car counter is doing absolutely everything in their power to do all but rent me a car. 
     I understand that I am fairly young, 23 years of age. They completely ignore the policy listed on the website. They ignore the sign right in front of my face sitting in clear view on top of the counter facing me, but away from the employee. They give me excuses such as “The debit card &amp; proof of round trip travel accommodation only applies to renters with an out of state drivers license”, “You must be at least 30 years old to use a debit card to rent a vehicle, unless you’re a government or military employee”. Even after attempting to have a family friend of mine currency in the US Air Force reserves. She immediately changes the policy to current DOD (Department of Defense), or US Military service members on as she seemed to explain current official business acting on behalf of the United States military interests. 
     At this point I believe she became suspicious, and was thinking that he was attempting to rent the car solely for the point of letting me drive it. I do not understand that after many attempts which as of this moment have failed. I have applied for a secured credit card through Self (formerly Self lender) a credit builder account/loan. And it will be another 60 days before I am actually going to even receive the card. 
     It is currently 6:30 AM (EST) as I’m posting this seeking ol’ reliable’s (Reddit) advice. I made a prepaid booking using my parents credit card and I know I can get the reservation canceled, along with a refund even though last minute low rate prepaid bookings on Hotwire, or Priceline for rental vehicles are typically non-refundable, &amp; cannot be changed, modified, or cancelled. 
      I have had some luck in the past joining National car rentals Emerald Club which is a service that allows you to go straight to the rental cars and just pick one on the marked emerald club aisles, hop in any car you pick &amp; drive off. 
       However, before you can exit the airport with the vehicle you’re required to stop at the gate maintained by an employee who does once last confirmation and since you’re skipping the counter someone has to verify your drivers license. I am aware that you can add &amp; manage payment methods online, so I could in theory use my parents credit card and rental car companies actually have no way of verifying what name is connected to the card you link. I have had success with this once back in 2016 when the new Mustangs were just going on sale. 
       I checked the most recent &amp; updated Terms and conditions of the emerald club and no longer does it say like in the past that newly updated credit cards and brand new emerald club members must present the card to the booth employee when leaving. I had a buddy who did the same thing once and he gave them a prepaid monkey Visa card and the employee did not even swipe the card, and if he did for some reason they allowed him to leave with no issues, and even after he turned in his vehicle they still ended up charging the credit card he did not have present with him. 
      I apologize for the long post/question. New to reddit (TL;DR?): I need to rent a car from the same state my license is issued from. Do not have credit card nor anybody who can rent the vehicle for me. However, I do have 4 different debit cards linked to a SoFi checking account, MoneyLion both Roar Checking, and regular moneylion checking, separate visa debit cards issued from both accounts, and last but not least the card that gave me this idea a GreenDot Bank visa debit card. 
       This card does not say debit card on it so I truly believe that as long as they just swipe my card and I tell them it’s just a GreenDot secured credit card, or my SoFi MasterCard also has a much more modern design and my activation sticker does a good job of inconspicuously covering up the debit card marking on the SoFi card. I really desperately need to pick up this rental car and get this to work. Rental car companies run all cards from my understanding as credit so no pin would ever be requested. Also note hotels as far as I know cannot tell the difference between a debit or credit card. Thanks!"
CreditCards,"Hi, I have good credit, hovers right around 800 or so. I have a lease, one credit card, student loans, and a google line of credit.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on this subreddit for a few days and everything I have read has been super helpful. I just want to ask a few questions that I am hoping some of you can answer.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is applying for multiple credit cards really that ideal? I see a bunch of people on here strategizing how to acquire a bunch of the Chase ones. I even notice that a guy has CFU and is still applying for Chase Freedom. Should I do this as well?
2. Do student loans have a huge affect on whether or not one is approved for a credit card?
3. Today I went from 35% utilization to 8%. Should I expect a huge jump in my credit score?
4. Is it possible to get the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card as your first credit card?

&amp;#x200B;

**# of Credit Cards:** 0 (I am an authorized user on my mother's); (2 years and three months credit age)

CreditCards,"Gotta love when you’re neck deep in a thoughtful post and a swipe between apps nukes your work.  🤦‍♂️ 

Two cards...wanna switch them out to something newer.  Stick with 1 AmEx 1 Visa...

AmEx Blue - OG card from 05 or so...

Chase Slate - was some entry card originally from late 2000s. 

I don’t travel much but would like to, I do drive a lot so gas is a thing, Costco is a thing, I sub to Hulu, Crunchyroll and iTunes Music. Don’t eat out at expensive places all that often, shop mostly on Amazon.  

Part of this push is because I’m getting ready to move to a new apartment, and will be buying a lot of stuff to furnish it.  Would like to take advantage of the moment and hit on some good intro points deals if I can. 

Im pre-approved for most of the Chase offerings, CSR/CF/etc, and am pretty sure i would qualify for AmEx stuff.  I appreciate the high limit on my AmEx but I’m never hoping to get into that kind of debt. Have zero on both cards and other than revolving credit through daily use I’m not living beyond my means again. 

Experian says 786, so should be good for something. :)

Thank you for the advice!"

CreditCards,"I recently applied and got approved for the Citi Double Cash card. So far my initial impressions with Citi have not been great

# Initial card activation woes

There software suite app and online web application seem subpar/buggy when compared to other card providers. For example, when approved for the card you setup a username and password. When you receive the card it tells you, you can activate the card via mobile app. The problem is when you try and login in for the first time on the app to activate the card it tells you, you are unable to logging until you create your security questions, which you must do online. There are other disconnects like this as well when trying to setup the rest of the account in the app, for example you can only enter a phone number in the browser, meaning you have to break workflow in the app to go to certain things that can only be done online. And their site tries to use flash...ickkkk  


# Second time using the card: account locked and verification unable to be completed on the phone with customer service

I used the card for the first time at a brick and mortar store with no problems. A couple of days later I was making my first online purchase on Amazon. About 15 minutes after making the purchase since it was my first time using the card I opened the app to just make sure everything went through correctly. Upon doing that I saw I had an alert ""To protect these accounts we need you to call us right away. Your ability to use there accounts may be limited until we hear for you"". I click past the app and don't see the Amazon charge. Okay this is weird I received no active notification from Citi in anyway, no email, no phone call, no push notification of a problem.

I called them and they tell me they need to do a couple of things to verify my identity. They ask from my secret word, I give it to them. They ask for my phone number I have on file so they can send me a text message to verify my identity. The lady informs me they are unable to use that phone number to verify me and ask if I have another number to provide. (I'm lost at how a new arbitrary number can be used for verification). This all fails. The lady is unable to verify me and unable to tell me why. I obviously can't find out why the card got locked because they can't identify. She informs me the only other option to verify me is to send me snail mail which can take 5 to 7 business days. So now I'm sitting on a bricked card because who knows why?  


After getting off the phone I verified my phone number was correct in my profile. When entering the phone number in your profile for the first time you have verify it with a text message code; so there is no way the phone number isn't mine."

CreditCards,I currently am not in the Chase or AMEX ecosystem yet (only have the Chase Freedom). I'd say my monthly spending is usually around $500-600. The AMEX gold card will require $4000 spent in 6 months. I was wondering if I should push for this?
CreditCards,"I wasn't sure if there is a preferred way to open up a second chase CC as the 1st time I did; I filled out a form online. I could go in branch, though the app / account (I think) or fill it out online through their website or random ad offer. I wasn't sure if there's a particular way people recommend that gives the highest chance of approval? Thanks

My BCE limit is $1000 but i did hear about people’s limits being higher compared to the approval limit and the card when it comes in the mail. I was very hyped to get approved for both of these since I am going to be able to hit the 60k SUB on the gold and the SUB on BCE very easily within the 6 months!"
CreditCards,"Seeing as the Discover card currently has 5% cashback on the PayPal category, I was wondering if there was some way I could still get this discount from buying through PayPal on Amazon (as PayPal is currently not a supported purchasing option). I've looked at the PayPal Cash Card but that works more like a debit card, so not sure if there's any other way to bypass this.

Thanks!"

I’ve been wanting to apply for the United Explorer card but I’ve waited since I just got the Freedom at the end of this past June. I also want the Gold card at some point, especially since i got the 75k sign up bonus offer for the card (prequalified). Ideally, I want both cards soon but there are several considerations I could use help weighing in on.

I’m pretty sure applying for both cards is going to make the order of applications important. One of my worries is that I don’t know how long the increased Amex Gold offer will last, so grabbing the card now is tempting. However, I know the United increased offer ends 9/30/2020. I worry that if I apply for the Gold first, Chase will have more reason to reject the United application based on too many new accounts (1 opened March 2020 and 1 June 2020). I don’t worry as much about Amex denying on that same condition. What would be the best strategy for me acquiring both of these cards before their sign-up bonuses are changed?

TL DR I wanted the United Explorer Card first but the new 75k Amex Gold offer happened. But I still want both cards."
CreditCards,"I am trying to refer my sister to a discover card. She has limited credit history and should probably apply for a student version. However, I have the regular version. I was wondering if my referral code would work for her to apply for a student card."
CreditCards,"So on my experian app it says my credit age is 10 months (excludes a card I am AU)

On CK it says 2yrs 1 month (Transunion) 2yrs 3 months (Equifax)  I'm an AU on my dad's card that he opened in 2008."
CreditCards,"I had recently got my Discover Chrome card product changed to a Discover It Cashback, because I had the Chrome for a year and I wanted the 5% cashback. I just received and activated the new Discover IT card today, do I just throw away the old Discover Chrome?"

CreditCards,"College student here with an account with Wells Fargo. I filed for bankruptcy like 5 or so months ago and now I am thinking of opening up credit card with WF to build up my credit again. 

Currently its 662

Not sure what type of card to apply for? Heres a list being offered by WF: https://www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/find-a-credit-card/all/

My needs is really any card that will get me to build my credit up. I don't use credit to pay for stuff. Should I go for the cash back college one? Not sure I am dumb about this stuffs!"
CreditCards,"So I've been considering  applying for this card sue to the fact that it's one of the few cards that still has Price protection benefit according to their guide of benefits here    https://shp.csharmony.epsilon.com/pages/Synchrony-Retail_Card-Ebates/33162_RF21267_17_EBS_Visa_GTB_LP  

However another user in this sub claimed some weeks ago extended warranty being the only available benefit once you give them a call to start a claim.I tried calling myself the number listed in the pdf but they told me I needed to call Rakuten directly to confirm, which of course once I did informed me I needed to call Synchrony bank to answer my question...which of course informed I needed to call visa directly (since price protection is a visa benefit)  to sumarize, no one seems to have any idea"
CreditCards,"I'm 30 years old and I have never had a credit card. I always heard horror stories about them so I never had an interest. I've never been great with managing money but the older I get the more I understand the importance of getting better at it and establishing better credit. Problem is I have no clue how. Most of my research has lead me to getting a credit card and building credit that way, but I have bad credit and don't qualify for any.

How do you build your credit back up if you can't get a credit card? My credit score is 580. I had some medical bills I couldn't pay back when I was unemployed with no insurance.  A $500 phone bill from around that same time period. Never had a credit card, ever. 

I know reddit can be toxic and full of sarcasm but if you have some real advice for me I'd appreciate it very much. I really want to work toward fixing this.

Thank you"
CreditCards,"I have 2 cards from regional southeast banks that are serviced/owned by Elan. How does this arrangement work? I have a much higher credit limit on the card with the higher APR. I would like to move some of that CL to the lower rate card. Is that possible or do the regionals whose name is on the card still have a hand in it? I am under the impression that Elan is the real credit grantor (not local bank A and local bank B)....and if so, it shouldn't be a problem, right?

Edit: Does Elan have a 5/24 limit or something equivalent? How many Elan cards can one have? I would like to add an Amex cash back card to my fleet at some point..."
CreditCards,"I'm not sure if I plan on getting the AMEX trifecta. I don't plan on traveling internationally my life, only domestically, but I'd most likely use my points for hotels. I think it'd be better to go with the Chase trifecta.

However, I've been targeted with a 75K MR SuB for the AMEX Gold card. I spend around 2-3K annually on dining. I spend probably 1K annually on groceries (living with parents right now).

Would it be worth holding this card?"
CreditCards,"I run about 70k per year of my business cable / internet / power / water bills 


I currently use a personal capital one card, with 1% return. 
Capital One classifies them as 2 catagories 
1. Phone / Cable
2. Utilities. 



Is there a better card to use ??  Not an Amex. Most utilities still don’t take it. Bonus points if a biz card and not personal."
CreditCards,"Hi

I have a 800+ credit score with a six figure income.  I usually get approved instantly for credit cards but post covid I am having some issues (rejected by Wells fargo and US bank is reviewing my application).  Anyone else noticing this or is it just me?"
CreditCards,"I am an authorized user on my parent's card which has a credit limit that is higher than my income from part time work.

Before I go out and get denied for a card, I would like to know if this high credit limit would count against me when a card issuer is considering issuing me a card.

If it would affect me, should I get removed from that card first?

I'm interested in a Capital One card, specifically the Journey student card if possible. Capital One CreditWise shows a VantageScore 3.0 score of 776."
CreditCards,Say that I have $20 left of credit to pay but my automatic payment is set to pay off $25 each month; will my credit card still charge me $25 and I end up paying an extra $5 for no reason or will it just charge me $20?
CreditCards,"Check your emails, got a 3.99% promotional APR for 7-months on the garbage Uber credit card. I myself am not going to take advantage of it but I know some of ya will."
CreditCards,"Hello Everyone,

I previously applied for the Chase Slate for the sign up bonus March 2019. I later PC'd the Slate into the CFU in November 2019.

So my question is, could I PC my CFU into another Chase card and apply for the CFU sign up bonus?"
CreditCards,"First off my income is 41,000 + (5,000 To 10,000) depending on how my gig goes. I have a FICO score of 705 according to Experian. My total debt is ~47,000 with 38,000 being student loans and 9,000 being an auto loan. 

My credit has gone up from 600 - 705 mostly in the last 6 months from paying off collections and getting a credit card. I started with a basic cap one card that has a small $200 limit. I want to upgrade to something that either gives me cash back or miles and has a limit of at least $1000. I plan on paying for all my extra expenses outside of recurring bills with this card which should be $200-$300 a month. 

What card should I apply for? Should I cancel my previous card if I get approved?"
CreditCards,"I am pre-approved for Chase United and Southwest. I want to get the card with the best value - for airlines or hotel stays with the least Annual fees. Which one should I pick? I already have 65,000 points through CSP. If I go with Southwest card - would I be eligible for their companion pass after having 130,000 points and transferring it to Southwest?

CreditCards,"I heard I was denied for a visa platinum from Bank of Oklahoma/Elan Financial services. I was told it was due to ""insufficient tradelines"" on my transunion report. I checked my transunion while on the phone with Elan Underwritting and saw that all 6 of my credit cards were there. I asked how many tradelines I would need to qualify for their visa platinum and they said the couldnt tell me the exact number required. Any reason why this happend?  Im considering trying to get a secured visa from them but they claim it means another hard pull. What would you do?"
