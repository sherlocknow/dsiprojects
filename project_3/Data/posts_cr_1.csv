It seems like it can’t be that bad, because they are offering to help, but after some research I’ve learned that these types of scams will start with them paying off debt and then following up by asking you to buy things on your credit card to help them. They will pay off your debt with stolen cards and it will appear as though you’re at a 0 balance, but once fraud is discovered, the amount that was paid off will be replaced, including anything extra you paid for the person.

**ME:** 29-year-old, bad credit, fluctuating income (freelancer), no credit card debt, no student loan debt, no car payment, no rent or mortgage

**BACKGROUND:** ruined my credit after college by being dumb and irresponsible. Credit went down to 380 in 2017 and has since slowly recovered to 600s as the derogatory marks age

**CREDIT SCORE:** 597 Experian, 627 Equifax and 630 TransUnion as of today

**DEROGATORY CLOSED ACCOUNTS:** 

1. Bank of America Credit Card #1: account charged off for $75 - date of first delinquency 03/01/2017 - **PAID IN FULL**
2. Bank of America Credit Card #2: account closed at credit grantor's request - $1,929.00 was over 120 days past due - last activity date 11/01/2018 - **PAID IN FULL**
3. Chase Credit Card: account closed at credit grantor's request - $4,919.00 was over 120 days past due - date of first delinquency 07/01/2017 - **PAID IN FULL**

**NEUTRAL CLOSED ACCOUNTS:**

1. Macy's Store Credit Card: paid and closed at consumer's request in 2015 - no late payment
2. TJMaxx Store Credit Card: paid and closed at consumer's request in 2015 - no late payment
3. Chevron Credit Card: paid and closed at consumer's request in 2015 - no late payment

**OPEN ACCOUNT:**

1. Chase Credit Card: credit limit $3,000.00 - pay full amount each moth - 9 years &amp; 6 months

**HARD INQUIRIES:** Capital One Bank on 08/31/2020 (I just applied for their secured credit card)

**STEPS TAKEN:**

1. Paid off amount owed to closed credit cards
2. 100% on-time payment for 2 years
3. 30-40% credit utilization rate for 2 years
4. Added to my spouse's (825 credit score) credit card as an authorized user
5. Just got approved for a Discover secured credit card for $2,000. Will make sure this account's payment history is immaculate 
6. Just started a 12-month Self credit building loan. Will make sure this loan's payment history is immaculate

**QUESTION:**

1. I have no loan (own my car, parents paid for college, parents own the apartment I live in and don't charge me rent) and honestly am hesitant to apply for a one just for the sake of having it. However, I only have one open account on my credit report and can definitely benefit from more positive payments, hence signing up for Self. Is there any other non-auto, non-housing loans I should look into? 
2. I have not disputed the three derogatory accounts on my credit report because they are all accurate... However, I read people trying regardless and bet on auto-deletion if they don't respond in 30 days. Is that even true? So many people suggest PFD method, which did not work in my case at all. Granted, my debt was never sold to a third party. 

I really appreciate any insight you can offer. I regret everyday for not being responsible with personal finance and for ignoring my bad habits for way too long. I am however determined to continue working toward repairing my credit score slowly and steadily. My goal is to reach 720, which is the score I had back in 2015.

I'm 23 years old and I've recklessly racked up $13,000 in credit card debt.


My current credit score is 588 (Vantage score from Credit Karma). My mother recently purchased a new vehicle and agreed to let me borrow her old car for one year with no car payments (I realize how lucky I am and I am extremely thankful). This means I have 12 months to figure out how I'm going to finance a car.


**Here's the budget I'm working with...**

Monthly income (after taxes): $2,400

*Expenses:* 

Rent &amp; utilities: $1000

Car &amp; renters insurance: $179

Phone bill: $50

Gas: $60

Groceries/toiletries: $300

Entertainment/miscellaneous: $150

Pet care: $75 (varies but I'd like to set this aside each month)

---

This budget leaves me with $586/mo leftover. Seemed like plenty until I realized how much debt I'm in... 

American Express card: **$8,216 at 22.99%** *(limit = $8400)* Minimum payment: $167 

Discover card: **$4,562 at 17.99%** *(limit = $4,500)* Minimum payment: $92 

Comenity Capital Bank/ULTA card: **$62 at ?%** *(limit = $1,250)*


My credit score is 588. I'd like to bring it up to 650 as soon as possible and ideally higher than that 12 months from now. I have zero late or missed payments and zero derogatory marks. Only 1 hard inquiry in the past two years which is about to fall off. My total credit card utilization is at 92% right now, which is killing my score. I also only have 3 total accounts and they are all credit cards.


**A few other important factors** 
 
 1. I have zero savings left. Currently living paycheck to paycheck. 
 
 2. I usually get a monthly bonus in addition to my salary. This ranges typically from $400 - $600 but isn't a guarantee and there have been months where I didn't bonus, so I'm not including it as fixed income and I want to make a budget that works without this. 
 
 3. I own a broken down car that needs a new engine. It's worth around $2,000 as-is. 
 
 4. I have furniture in storage that I need to sell worth around $1000. 
 
 5. I have to cover any medical expenses out of pocket and get reimbursed out of an HSA account. This can take a few weeks to receive so I need to be able to float the money for any health care expenses. Right now this is really difficult because I have no savings and no available credit left to spend. 
 
 6. I have cancelled all monthly subscriptions (streaming services, gym membership, etc).


My plan this month is to pay off the entire Ulta credit card balance and to pay at least the minimum on my Amex and Discover cards.


This would leave me with about $250 leftover (once the Ulta card is paid it'll be over $300/mo). Realistically I'll be able to save more than this because I plan on being extremely frugal for the next few weeks and I over-budgeted for groceries and entertainment. I'm also anticipating on getting a bonus of around $400 this month.


My question is -- what's the smartest thing to do with any extra money I have each month?


Please help me come up with a plan here! Am I better off saving up as much as I can to build up a nest egg and then pay cash for a car in 12 months? Or am I better off working all year to bring up my credit score so that I can get a car loan? And is that even a realistic possibility given my situation? I'd like to consolidate my credit card debt and lower the APR, but with my current credit score my options are pretty limited. I stupidly racked up all this credit card debt while I was in school and now I'm paying for it.

What is with the scammers nowadays?

The last few weeks I have been receiving many phone calls and messages.

The phone calls they say they are from my benefits department and they wanna talk about having my rx delivered to me. 

The messages are coming from my credit banks. Like yesterday I received a message from chase saying they caught a potential fraudulent charge and asked to verify if it was me or not and reply.the message had chase symbole and looked legit.  I didn't reply. 

But today I saw the same message in my email. It is a very private email that I only use for banks and similar accounts. I don't use it for anything else and I don't open it that often.

Long story short, my fiancee and I are trying to buy a home.  Our credit is pretty clean, utilization under like 10%, maybe even 5% for him.  However, he left an apartment 4 years ago and they stuck him with a cleaning fee after he moved out.  They notified him of said cleaning fee on the 22nd of the month following via email stating he had 15 days to either dispute or pay or he would be turned over, which he disputed.  However, on the 31st of that same month, it showed up on his credit report as a collections which was 8 days after he was notified.  He wasn't even aware of any of this until months later and of course, it was too late then.  

Fast forward 4 years later to today, and our mortgage broker needs his credit to a 720 to get us approved.  The collection remains on 2 of the bureaus and we need it off of at least 1 and he will get about a 50 point boost.  The collection should not have been sent when it was in the first place.  We have disputed with the apartments, the collection agency and the bureaus.  Apartment and collections say they can do nothing.  Collections continues to verify it as accurate every time and refuses to provide us with documentation as to how they verified it as accurate.  

We have since been referred to a home loan assist place that supposedly is working on getting it removed but I can't get a straight answer as to what their process is and we are going on 2 months with them and no results.  The apartments have told me they are not even able to verify any of the information as they have changed systems and no longer have the info.  The collection agency of course, just verifies they were given a debt to collect, and the credit bureaus are literally violating the Fair Credit and Reporting Act as far as I can see.

,CRedit,"Hey guys,

Got a few questions that probably apply to others as well!

Need both a vehicle and personal loan at the same time for various reasons. Not a lot--about 7k for private used car sale, 3k personal.

Score is solid (704) and I make about $5k per month. Very low living expenses. Problems are:


-Self employed

-Havent filed tax returns yet for 18 and 19 (extenuating reasons; about to file shortly)

-Even if I had filed, it prob wouldn't help. In 18 I made good money but in 19 I basically made zero. Been consistently earning $5k monthly for about 5 months now but that's only this year.


Anything I can do to maximize likelihood of qualifying? What institutions are most likely to approve this? I'm willing to pay a little bit higher rate if it means I get approved on the first try. Typically I've used USAA for car loans previously.

Thank you!

,CRedit,"Hi guys,

Long time lurker, first time poster. I come to you guys looking for advice as a fresh college graduate.

I am going to be moving to an extremely competitive housing market in San Francisco where a lot of landlords are really stingy with credit scores.

I have been pretty careless with my credit cards, I make the minimum payment every month (which is just paying off the interest) and thats it. I don't really use my cards that much but am still holding onto a balance.

According to Credit Karma - **my transunion is a 636 and Equifax is a 633. My FICO score is currently 648.**

One issue that caused my utilization to shoot up is Paypal unexpectedly lowered my credit line from $3000 to $900 without any warning which made me go over my balance as I had about $910 sitting on my card, this understandably tanked my score. I have since **paid this entire account off as of writing.** Paypal never really explained why they reduced it, but it hurt my scores.

**Balances:**

Discover Card - $2740.38 @ 15.99% APR. Credit Line is $3000. I need to get this paid down.

Paypal - $910 @ 24% (i think) I have since PAID THIS OFF - but it hasnt shown up on my report yet.

Total Credit Lines combined --&gt; $3900.

I have been holding onto this debt as a college student because I have been studying full time so I was unable to pay off a lot of it. I understand I made some poor financial decisions but I will be starting work in 2 weeks in Consulting/Accounting so I will have a solid paycheck coming in, I've just been treading water until I start working.

**My question is - should I apply for a Personal Loan on Credit Karma so I can just get this Discover card paid down to a reasonable amount, or should I just wait until I start working and make larger payments on my Discover Card?**

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR --&gt; Holding a high balance on discover card, want to improve scores. Considering getting a personal loan.

,CRedit,"Hello! First I’d like to say thank you for taking the time to read my post, I know this is long but I will try to keep this as straight to the point as possible while still providing as much information as I can. 

I’m 25yo and on the road to repairing my credit, and right now I’m feeling a bit stuck/confused on what I should do next to help myself here. I’ll try to lay my info out as simple as possible.

First and only credit card is with Bank of America, it is a secured credit card with a $500 limit. I’ve had this card since January of 2018.

The only other thing on my credit is a medical bill that went to collections that was $378, this account was opened Feb. 14th, 2019.

I have ALWAYS 100% of the time made my credit card payments on time, never late once, although I will admit for about a year it was sitting at about $400 used of $500 limit, just recently have I been able to bring that balance down to $0 every month. So my credit utilization right now is 0% which has helped my credit score. 

The collections of $378 was recently completely paid off in one large sum, in hopes that it would also help my credit. On certain credit monitoring services, it did the opposite. It dropped my score drastically.

Right now my credit score from BoA which uses TransUnion and is a FICO score is sitting at 620 (9 points lower than it was last month before paying off the collections).

On the other hand, my TransUnion score provided from TurboTax is 734 (up about 50 points after paying off the collections).

I have 0 credit inquiries which is good. I have 1 derogatory mark which is fair. I have 2 other medical bills that went to collections, but I stopped them and payed them before they were reported to the credit bureaus so nothing else should come to haunt my credit.

About a month ago before I paid off the collections and my score was 629 from BoA, I attempted to have my secured credit card switch over to an unsecure credit card and have my limit raised to $1,000, to which I was denied. The lady on the phone told me that it would look better if the collections balance was $0, which is really what sparked the idea to pay it off. She was wrong cause my score from boa dropped.

So given all that information, the only thing I can seem to get approved for is another secured credit card from discover. I applied for the Apple Card about a month ago and also got denied (I’m trying to finance a new MacBook). But I’m wondering if it would be a smarter decision to try to get a loan from my bank, that way I have different types of credit?
Also, I’ve read places that writing a letter to the collections agency and asking them to stop reporting it can be helpful so I plan on trying that in hopes that they might see my credit card payment history and be able to work with me. I would love some advice on what I can do in this moment to raise my credit score, as I’m feeling a bit stuck. I’ve seen people with worse credit history get approved for things I feel like I would get denied for and that’s disheartening.

,CRedit,"Hi. This is my first time posting here so sorry if I made some errors, please let me know if you find one.

I am now a Junior in high school in Southern California as a South Korean international student (NOT an exchange student), and I am getting a green card soon because of my mom’s investment thing in San Fransisco. As stated in the title, I am 17 year old and turn 18 next July.

While looking things up on Google, I found some ways to get my credit scores higher and one is churning. Take a look at what I wrote based on all those things on Google and Youtube:

——————————— THESE ARE THE THINGS I WROTE DOWN ON MY NOTE———————————————

1. Get a Chase bank account in prior to getting a green card and SSN as an international student. Use the savings account and have a certain amount of money in there for at least 6 months

2. Wait until I get the green card and become a legal permanent resident. (I think this will be around my sophomore year in college)

3. Make a secured card from USBank/ Citi/ Chase/ WF/ BoA/ Capital One/ Discover and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 750-790 is expected, but a fragile one.

4. Get a CF or CFU and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 800 or near that is expected, but still a fragile one.

5. Get credit cards from each companies (Amex, Chase, BofA)

After 6 months, I would be able to lease a Honda  Accord or Toyota Camry (Maybe?)

- The credit score can easily go down, so I have to have a mortgage or a car loan to make it a sturdy credit score
- Try to do things above online not on the phone or in person unless the bank calls you or bank wants you to call them
- I can use other cards from Korea or use my debit card when I can’t use my credit cards because of the limit

For the longest time I have heard (kinda in passing) that there is a specific window of time in which you are supposed to pay your credit card balance in order for said payment to substantially help you improve your credit scores. The only thing I know for sure is that I always pay my \[lone\] credit card balance before the payment is due. That has always been my one ""strategy"" to ensure that my credit is solid, BUT...I keep sorta kinda hearing that there is a more specific way.

Do you know what I am talking about? Or is this all something I somehow imagined?

If this helps, my payments' date due is the 14th of the month (I usually pay the bill around the tenth), and my credit card statements documenting the whole thing come out on the 17th. The statement usually has, say ""July 18 to August 17, 2020-31 days in billing cycle"" as part of the text.

,CRedit,"The last few months I have finally been earning more than enough money to pay off all my bad debt, I've also been learning more about how credit works and how to bump up my score. I had about $7000-$8000 in credit card debt, and got that lowered down to $2600 in a matter of a few of months. This is across 4 cards. I thought making small chunks would benefit my score more than paying them all down completely at once.

After paying down that debt and disputing a couple of other collections, my score went from 550's to 670 FICO for pretty much all 3 bureaus. Im now at the point where I have about $2600 left in credit card debt across 4 cards (each at about 10%-15% utilization or less), with one of the cards being one that was closed due to late payments. The balance on the one that got closed is $1363. (Funny enough when it got closed, my score went up, but nonetheless its still showing as current and being paid)

I think where my main problem is at the moment is an auto lease at Hyundai that I turned in back in 2018 and never made the final ""lease end payment"" (Always on time with the regular monthly payment for the 3 years I had it) This ended up turning into a charge off after never paying it past the 30/60/90. I went ahead and paid the amount in full recently which was for $2000 on 08/12/2020.

I tried to apply for a Tesla as of this past week as this was one of my main goals, and got denied through their leasing/financing and also got denied at Alliant CU as well. The Hyundai thing was mentioned as one of the reasons for not getting approved (since it still has not dropped of my report).

I had about $7000-$8000 in credit card debt, and got that lowered down to $2600 in a matter of a few of months. This is across 4 cards. I thought making small chunks would benefit my score more than paying them all down completely at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After paying down that debt and disputing a couple of other collections, my score went from 550&amp;#39;s to 670 FICO for pretty much all 3 bureaus. Im now at the point where I have about $2600 left in credit card debt across 4 cards (each at about 10%-15% utilization or less), with one of the cards being one that was closed due to late payments. The balance on the one that got closed is $1363. (Funny enough when it got closed, my score went up, but nonetheless its still showing as current and being paid)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think where my main problem is at the moment is an auto lease at Hyundai that I turned in back in 2018 and never made the final &amp;quot;lease end payment&amp;quot; (Always on time with the regular monthly payment for the 3 years I had it) This ended up turning into a charge off after never paying it past the 30/60/90. I went ahead and paid the amount in full recently which was for $2000 on 08/12/2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to apply for a Tesla as of this past week as this was one of my main goals, and got denied through their leasing/financing and also got denied at Alliant CU as well. The Hyundai thing was mentioned as one of the reasons for not getting approved (since it still has not dropped of my report). Disappointing but I guess this is expected, but was trying to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit karma is telling me I have a 567 transunion and 598 equifax credit score. On the experian app, it says my score is a 627. I’m not sure why the scores are so scattered apart but I just want to get my score in the 750 range at the very least. 

I have an auto loan with 10 months remaining. This account is killing me. It has 9 late payments! I have been up to date and on time for the past 9-10 months. The late payments are scattered from 1-3 years ago. 

I have a capital one card which I opened in may 2020 with a 300$ limit. It is increasing to 500$ for September after making payments on time.

I started the credit builder on the self app in June 2020 and been making payments on time.

I got approved today for the discovery secured card (200$) and that should arrive in the mail in 2 weeks. 

My credit utilization is at 5% at the moment but it’s typically around 10-15%. 

I have 1 account in collections just in  my transunion account which i disputed because I had them agree to remove it. Account was opened feb 2015.

Then I have a child support account only on my equifax account with 43 missed payments!! This account was paid off but also terminated by a judge on July 2020 and the other credit Bureaus removed the account but not equifax. I also disputed this account for inaccurate information. 

So what else can I do? I feel like I am stuck. I want to purchase a home next year but my score sucks. I know I’ve made mistakes in the past but I have been doing well to correct them.

It is still wrong.  Despite speaking to Ally 5 times over the past 2 months and them asserting they had corrected the information, they are still sending incomplete and incorrect data.

In October 2019 I opened up a $200 credit card (that has since increased to $500) and a few months after applied for a secondary card. For almost a year now I have kept my utilization at 10-15% at all times. 

My credit has been completely stagnant for the past five months or so, at 620~ moving up and down a few points every now and then.

2) Capital One - $500 Limit ($450 available)

3) Credit One - $500 Limit ($450 available)

 Do I continue to apply for cards/loans to increase my lines of credit? 


Or


Do I hold off on applying for anything and just continue to pay on these two cards?

It's too late to contact anyone, but I'm freaking out, so to reddit I go....

It's now August 27, 2020 and I start getting credit notifications and I go and look....Ford just reported to the credit agencies that I am delinquent....they are missing my July 23 and Aug 23 payments.....no kidding, I traded the truck in on July 10.....what the hell do I do?

,CRedit,"Hi all,

I'm still educating myself on how all this works and hope this isn't an odd question with an obvious answer, but I appreciate any advice you can offer. I am trying to figure out if it will hurt or help my credit score to remove my authorized user status from my parents' credit card. I'm also wondering if it would benefit me to open a new credit card to increase my available limit/decrease overall utilization (maybe I would do that instead of remove myself?). I've listed my active accounts below for a quicker overview:

—JPMCB Credit Card - $20,000 limit, $7,000 balance. Est. 2005. Authorized user. 

—MasterCard through our credit union - $3,000 limit, $0 balance. Est. 2013. Joint credit.

—Navient-owned student loan - $10,000 remaining balance. (about 30% paid off) Est. 2007. 

—Auto loan through our credit union - $13,000 remaining balance (about 20% paid off) Est. 2019 (over a year ago, so no hard pulls in at least 1 year)

—Capital One Quicksilver Rewards - $3,000 limit, $0 balance. Est. 2020. Authorized user. (Not currently displaying on the report/reflected in the score yet because it was recently opened.)

No missed or delinquent payments on any accounts, active or closed. No account ever sent to collections, active or closed. (I had various federal student loans and one Best Buy card which were all paid on time and have since been closed.)


Here are some details for context (pulling this from Experian since they include the balance on my parents' card):

I was recently notified of a 22 point drop in my Experian FICO score due to Loan Balances. I have an auto loan and a student loan that make up about $23,000 in loan debt. Current FICO is 788 (which means I went from Exceptional to Very Good and as a constant over-achiever I'm kinda bummed at the drop in status, even though I know it's still really good!). There's not much I can do about my installment loans besides continue paying them off on time. I’m not sure what prompted the drop but that’s a question for another day.

Anyway, it got me wondering if there’s anything I can do to improve the score. My parents' card is the oldest item in my credit report (opened in 2005), because back in the day they added me as an authorized user to help me establish my credit. They have never missed a payment. However, there is a standing balance on the card of about $7,000 (credit limit about $20,000). This balance is keeping me at an overall credit utilization of 30%. If this account were not included, my utilization would be 0% (or maybe some small percentage depending on the MasterCard balance at the time of the report).

I know there's no exact science to it, but as far as I understand there would be pros and cons to having me removed. Pro: that standing balance goes away from my report. Cons: that extra $20K credit limit also goes away; my next oldest account is my student loan from 2007 that I'm still paying down and then my joint credit card from 2013; it makes my file ""thinner"" as I don't have many credit cards; overall credit limit goes down.

Comparing the pros and cons would normally make me go, okay, too many cons, but am I missing something?

I don't typically have a standing balance on my credit cards because my husband and I only use them for things we can pay down immediately with our bank account. So I'm not concerned about my credit utilization going up due to a drop in total credit limit. But I am concerned about a lower overall credit limit if I get taken off my parents' card, and the fact that it's the oldest account in my file.

I've rambled on long enough. Like I said, I'm trying to educate myself and make the best decisions for my credit, so I truly appreciate any advice or feedback.

,CRedit,"First post but I need advice. Trying to build my wife’s credit so she applied for an Amazon store card so that she could get a laptop for online classes she just started. 

She was approved for $1200 from Synchrony Bank and we picked out a laptop. It was over the $1200 limit but we figured we’d pay the extra with our debit cards. Amazon’s cart wouldn’t give us that option but it did allow us to pay with 12 egual payments. Figured if it was ok with them then we were ok. 

Next day wife got an email saying the order was rejected. Ok. Over limit we get it. Picked out a laptop with only 1TB for under $1200. Wife forgot she bought $40 headphones on credit card. Order got rejected. 

Ok third time is a charm. Ordered smaller screen for under $1100. Order accepted. Next morning Amazon account is locked. They want her to prove that she is the account holder and authorized to use Synchrony account. 

She answered all personal questions they asked and sent email from Synchrony accepting her application for credit. Got email saying proof was a insufficient. Synchrony says they can’t help her. Dont know why. Don’t know what to do. 

So now she is stuck with a credit card that she can’t use. My question is how big of a hit will her credit take if she cancels the card? Can Synchrony transfer her credit to one of their other cards(Newegg?).

&lt;p&gt;She was approved for $1200 from Synchrony Bank and we picked out a laptop. It was over the $1200 limit but we figured we’d pay the extra with our debit cards. Amazon’s cart wouldn’t give us that option but it did allow us to pay with 12 egual payments. Figured if it was ok with them then we were ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day wife got an email saying the order was rejected. Ok. Over limit we get it. Picked out a laptop with only 1TB for under $1200. Wife forgot she bought $40 headphones on credit card. Order got rejected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok third time is a charm. Ordered smaller screen for under $1100. Order accepted. Next morning Amazon account is locked. They want her to prove that she is the account holder and authorized to use Synchrony account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She answered all personal questions they asked and sent email from Synchrony accepting her application for credit. Got email saying proof was a insufficient. Synchrony says they can’t help her. Dont know why. Don’t know what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now she is stuck with a credit card that she can’t use. My question is how big of a hit will her credit take if she cancels the card? Can Synchrony transfer her credit to one of their other cards(Newegg?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn’t the most informative post but any ideas would be helpful. Wife is in tears because she thinks her credit is shot.&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"I am shopping for mortgage loans to refinance my house. I found out that I had an 18 month old utility bill that was dinging my credit. I had a quote for a good rate, but thought it would help if I could bring up my average to 740 to get quotes at the “better” tier score. So I made the $54 late payment to So Cal Edison to remedy the past due balance.

Lo and behold, this payment I made triggered a negative impact to my score of 56 points to my experian reported Fico 8 score. 

I am livid about this. Experian reps told me that it triggered an event that otherwise wouldn’t have been triggered. They claim they can do nothing about this. Trans union and equifax were not impacted, maybe since it was a Fico8 impact only.

I can’t begin to explain how upset I am that this $54 payment can cost me literally thousands of dollars since I am now getting a much worse rate quote for refinancing my house. I do not understand why there are so many different credit algorithms that a mortgage rate can be impacted by MAKING A $54 utility payment! 

I have 18 years of mortgage payment history, no late payments. I have 2 late credit card payments from 5 years ago. The stupidity of how inaccurate these credit scores are with estimating risk of borrowers is astounding to me.

I need to vent about this, but I am also hoping that there is someone out there that can offer any advice on anything I can do to reverse this 56 experian point drop. Anyone????

,CRedit,"Hello, 
I am a 26f who made some awful mistakes with credit cards at a young age. I got my first credit card at 22 and since then I had started racking up credit to the point where I have an American Express credit card at $12,500 and a Chase card at $2,300. I am terrible with money and always have been, but I didn’t understand that even if I made every credit payment on time, it would still hurt my credit tremendously having this much on only two cards. I didn’t check my credit score until it was too late and I am at 600 (credit karma). I am terrified and also horrified for my parents to find out. I always knew that the job I would get out of school would put me at making at least 80,000-100,000 grand a year. Unfortunately I have become extremely depressed due to school stressors and my credit card debit, that I have put myself and my future into jeopardy. 

I currently have about $4,000 in savings and am I living at home with my parents. I don’t have a car payment or any other bills really at this time, but I don’t have an income either. I am currently studying to take a Board exam since I graduated college. Due to my depression and constant anxiety about my debt, I have not been able to prepare for my board exam and will most likely have to retake it in November, which means I will not be able to get a job until at least December in my field. I am planning on applying to jobs after this first test in two weeks, so I hope to start making an income at that time. I am getting help from my partner, but he is only able to give me about $200 a month, or half of my monthly payments (which is amazing within itself). 

Soon I will need to get a car and I am terrified that my credit will keep decreasing and I am not sure what to do about it at this point. I have applied to remote jobs online to make some extra income, but I feel like everything is crashing down on me at once and I’m not sure what to do. 

I am going to start selling my old clothes and whatever else I don’t need. I also have decreased my food budget. Basically I have no bills currently either. Probably $150 a month for food and $240 a month for therapy. I will need to start making student loan payments in November (total of about $60,000), but my parents have offered to help me with that until I can get a job in my field. I can’t tell my parents about my debt, because my mother had made the mistake of racking up $10,000 on a credit card without my father’s knowledge and he almost left her. I don’t know how I didn’t learn from that, but I didn’t and I am in a huge mess. 

Is there anything I can do to stop my credit from declining? Any advice? I made horrible mistakes that I will have to continue to pay for awhile and I am aware of that. I am horrified that my parents will disown me and stop helping me if they find out about this mistake, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Any advice on legally making a decent amount of money on the side?

,CRedit,"I’ve never put any thought into this and frankly I have always assumed it didn’t matter what kind of card you have. A credit card is a credit card.

However, a few things have me thinking. First, MyFICO gives me updates about report changes. It singles out retail cards. As in I receive notifications that state, “your retail card balances have decreased” while I will simultaneously receive alerts that might say, “your over all credit usage has gone up” and “your balance has decreased” and then list which card. It always lets you know about retail cards by static retail card.

Second, in MyFICO’s simulator they list opening a new credit card and retail card as separate items that you can simulate.

Lastly, one of my credit cards provided FICO score summaries lists what’s hurting and what helping your score. One of the things that is supposedly hurting me is “consumer credit account”. Now, I don’t know if it’s talking about a personal loan or a retail card. Sounds like it could be either.

Regardless of the last item, I find the first two things a little odd.

&lt;p&gt;However, a few things have me thinking. First, MyFICO gives me updates about report changes. It singles out retail cards. As in I receive notifications that state, “your retail card balances have decreased” while I will simultaneously receive alerts that might say, “your over all credit usage has gone up” and “your balance has decreased” and then list which card. It always lets you know about retail cards by static retail card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in MyFICO’s simulator they list opening a new credit card and retail card as separate items that you can simulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, one of my credit cards provided FICO score summaries lists what’s hurting and what helping your score. One of the things that is supposedly hurting me is “consumer credit account”. Now, I don’t know if it’s talking about a personal loan or a retail card. Sounds like it could be either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the last item, I find the first two things a little odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really the only retail cards that I have - I use for store specific discounts/rewards. Such as synchrony’s Amazon card and my wife’s target and old navy card.&lt;/p&gt;

So I've been on the hunt recently for a roommate / rooming situation, and there are a lot of regular joes out there posing as landlords (who might very well be landlords) that are asking for a LOT of personal info unencrypted (SSN, credit report, sometimes even a DL number). I'm taking a pause on the roommate searching situation for other reasons, so no one is getting my info for at least a month or two regardless.

Now, I already requested a credit report on [freecreditreport.com](https://freecreditreport.com) (dumb, I know, should've gone to annualcreditreport instead, learned after the fact) and entered the last 4 digits of my SSN, and it got me thinking: where else have I slipped this info over the years? 

I've been looking into freezing my credit, because I currently have one credit card open and will not be opening any lines of credit + making large purchases anytime soon. I'm pretty private + social media free so most basic info is devoid from the internet besides my LinkedIn (which is as private as anyone can make it), so I'm not doing a terrible job but with my low maintenance style of living, I want to know a couple of things before potentially freezing:

1) Is this a good preventative measure worth executing to protect identity theft? I've been reading enough to say that it is, and this is the primary reason I want to do it. Again I'm not a big spender and don't mind jumping through the hoops to unfreeze it every now and then (at the same time, I also want to have a better idea of how easy / difficult it is to freeze and unfreeze credit). 

2) Can I still accrue credit from my credit card if I freeze my credit?

3) How can freezing my credit hurt me? What are the cons?

,CRedit,"So I will start this by saying this is kinda of a long story,it’s about my girlfriend , and any information will help.


About four years ago my gf applied online to live at a apt complex designed for college students. She applied , was told she needed a guarantor so she asked her mom to apply. It came back that her mom did not get approved , so she just assumed that she wasn’t  going to get the place and moved on. Later on she got a notice about her move in date and where she was going to live . She was confused so she called them and told them she wasn’t going to live there , her guarantor didn’t even get approved , she never signed a lease to stay there and she couldn’t afford to stay there. They told her that her applying online was the lease and that she would be liable for a broken lease if she didn’t move in. 

So you can probably see where this went . She didn’t move in and they charged her 7k . It got sent to collections and now she has a rental based collections on her credit report. I’ve tried to dispute it for her using the basic disputes on credit karma and such but nothing has happened . 

I’m just taken aback that they could even do this . She never gave a deposit , never got a letter about evictions , never went to court and her guarantor even got denied when she applied . She even states that she never signed a lease , but thinks that when she “applied “ it must have been a lease too or something .

,CRedit,"Hey guys! Was hoping I could pick your brains on this as I am planning to move apartments (just renting) this coming October. 

Currently, my credit score has dipped to 642 (used to be 705) in the last year or so for a number of reasons. However, while the score is fair, I am concerned that some landlords might require me to get a guarantor when I apply for a new apartment. 

Would it make sense for me to get a personal loan now as I'm getting offers so I can pay off the credit card debt, in the hopes of increasing my score in time for the next month or 2? 

Not sure how it works...will I immediately pay off the debt with the loan they give me? Will even just getting a loan now hurt my current score? 

Other details for context:

- I can't use a guarantor as I don't have one. I'm Filipino American but both my parents live in the Philippines and no longer have US bank accounts/active credit history and if I were to use a guarantor, I'd only want it to be them.

- I'm apartment hunting in NYC.

- Income wise, I'm good. It really is just the impact of the credit score that worries me as I know they look into that first.

,CRedit,"Hello all,

I have a $783 bill from AT&amp;T back from like 2017 after I lost my job.  I am on much better financial ground right now and was trying to clean up my report as best I can so I can improve my scores even further and get some decent rewards cards.  I’ve been doing fairly well with my two secured cards and self loan and have gotten up to about 642 over the past 8 months.  One thing that I think is hurting my score from rising even more is this AT&amp;T collection that is being serviced by ERC.  I believe att still owns the debt and they are just contracted.  

Since they “took over” in early 2019 they have been posting a late payment mark every month like clockwork since April2019.  Are they allowed to do this?  I never have had any contact with them since they started servicing in January 2019.  I never entered into any agreement with them.  Could I dispute it?  I do have more than enough money saved to pay their original settlement offer I just found in my collections/junk mail pile...or even the full balance.  If I could somehow get this purged I would gladly pay the full balance.  Would paying ATT be possible and then just disputing the negative marks?

So I have a negative account on my credit that is from an old gym membership. However, it was on contract for 10 a month for 12 months. I think I made it 3 months in and forgot about it ( I believe I started working out with friends at another gym) and forgot to cancel it.

So how could they keep charging me for something they won’t allow me to use, and if its 10 a month for 12 months ($120) how could they possibly justify $500?

About 2.5 years ago I had a contract with a pest control company, but canceled it over the phone via their 800 number due to poor customer service by the local branch (they never answered or returned my calls). About a month later I recieved a charge on my credit card for the $100 quarterly service. I called the 800 number again and received a refund and verbally confirmed that my account had been canceled during the original call. A couple of weeks later I started receiving emails from my credit card company that the pest control company was attempting to charge $100. I called the local branch about 5-6 times then called the 800 number and was told it would be escalated and they would contact the branch and instruct them to contact me. I repeated this process every 2-3 weeks for about 6 months and never received any call from the local branch. After about 8 months from when I was originally told the contract was canceled, I finally received a call from a service technician who claimed a complete service had been performed about a month after the cancellation (which would have required me to be home to bring in my 2 german shepherds and open the locked gate to let their tech into the backyard), she then informed me that her manager had told her I had to pay. I explained the full story above to her, and she said she would speak to her manager and call me back, and that was the last time I heard from them, despite me calling their branch multiple times to follow up. 

About 6 months later (just over a year ago) I received a collection letter from an agency about the $100. I looked into what to do to dispute it, and sent them my dispute which included names, and dates/times, and details of all the phone calls, as well as copies of my credit card statement showing the initial charge, and subsequent refund for the ""service performed."" All the articles I saw said to send it as certified mail so I could prove they received it before the 30 days were up, so that is what I did. I never received any further communication from them. It has now been approximately 13 months from when I sent my dispute and yesterday I received a letter from a collection agency (I have to look for the old letter so I don't know if it is the original agency or if it is a different one) attempting to collect, complete with another notice that I have 30 days to dispute. 

Can anyone advise me on how to proceed? It was my understanding that if my dispute wasn't addressed within 30 days, it essentially meant I won.

,CRedit,"Hi all, first time posting here. 

I am 31 years old trying to really fix my credit (675)  but I’m in a position that I need to take out a home equity loan against my house. This loan will be used for some needed renovation costs before I sell my house in the next month or two, likely before October’s end. 

I am wanting to know how this may impact my credit overall. I would essentially be borrowing against for 2-3 months once the sale of the house goes through and I will pay back the loan in full. Discover doesn’t charge early payoff other than a maximum of $500 to reimburse closing costs.

What could I expect to see with my credit score potentially and what are some things I need to consider before and after this loan. What steps will I want to take to repair my credit after, what I assume, will be a drop in my score?

With this loan I will also be able to pay down or off of the following OPEN ACCOUNTS (6)
- Car loan (15% - age: 4.1 year)
- SELF small short lender CD loan (age 2 months)
- small amount collections X2 totaling $300 (age ~ 4.8 &amp; 6.2 years) 
- home loan (4.8 years) 
- credit card ( ~25% utilization age 8.3 years)

Also plan to save a chunk of it to make the first set of payments on it, so would paying itself back be a bad idea? One would think not...

Any strategic tips to help me be better on the other side of this home equity loan?

My wife and I are looking at purchasing a new home with a considerably larger mortgage than we currently have and would like the application to go through with minimal hiccups. The home is new build, in Canada and looking at a purchase price of approximately 850k

On some occasions my visa will reach 50% utilization (during renovations, large purchases etc.) but always paid off in full and I’ve never paid interest. Should I apply for a credit limit increase to keep my utilization lower and will this affect my score to apply?

,CRedit,"Hey All,

I am very fortunate that I have good credit and because of this I am very conscious of things that may impact it.

Generally I have a great handle on how different things impact credit but I have hit something that is confusing me as to how it may impact my credit if I do it.

The used car market is nuts right now, I have a lease coming up that us way under mileage and my residual is under the trade value of the car. My lease terms are sticky and do not allow a dealership to buy out my lease, so my only chance to covert that equity into another car purchase is to buy the car so that I can trade it once the title is in my name.

I'm thinking I will buy it, then turn around and trade it effectively opening an auto loan to close it within a week or two when I trade and open another one on whatever I buy.

Will having an auto loan that lasts a few weeks just to close that one and open another one impact my credit more than just financing one loan? If it does I will probably just abandon the equity and turn in the lease.

Would this be like opening a credit card account to close it right away and open another (which I know is a bad move)?

,CRedit,"Hello all!

New to this sub but really nice to see a lot of good dialogue here.

I have been working to repair my credit the last 5 years and have been spotless since then but still have about 2 years left of a defaulted student loan that was resold and eventually eventually paid off in full.  Unfortunately it did not go through the rehabilitation process because my income at my sales job went up a lot in a short period of time which disqualified me from the rehabilitation payment plan.

The good part is I am 100% debt free for several years now and pay of my credit cards 2-3x per month to keep utilization below 5%.

Without being too long winded, I am looking for advice as my wife and I are looking to buy a home in the next 6 to 18 months depending on market conditions and how fast we can keep saving.

I subscribed to MyFico recently and wasn't too surprised that my Fico8 scores were a bit lower than my Vatage scored from Credit Karma and Mint.

Fico 8 
699 equifax
678 transunion
705 experian

My wife is closer to 800 so that does helps our situation.

Because we are looking to start a family, we know we need to replace my old but paid off Toyota Corolla to get something more family friendly.

We aren't driving much because of COVID so I dont want to buy a car now, but I'm concerned about waiting too long and it negatively impacting my credit when we go to get a mortage.

Does it make sense to get the car sooner so that we have 6-8 months of good payments and a new payment type on my credit if we are thinking of getting a house next year, or do we wait as long as possible on the car hoping we have a house before a baby and thus needing the new car?

,CRedit,"Basic question for those folks who have had car loans with an ACH debit for payments that have been paid off:

**Is the last payment--the payoff payment--usually processed automatically just like the rest of your payments have been?**

Background for question (bit of a long story):

We recently came to the end of the loan term on a car financed with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. We've had an ACH payment order set up with the lender since the loan inception, with a bank account that we no longer use for anything else. An automatic deposit from a paycheck went to that account to cover that one payment to NMAC, and we don't look at that bank account much. The NMAC account was set for paperless statements, but the email address connected to the NMAC account was no longer accessible.

I happened to look at our credit score (that we've spent years repairing after a foreclosure and bankruptcy many years ago, and not so great spending habits more recently) in early May, only to see that our 800+ FICO 3 score (from Experian) was down to 700-something (and now it's even lower, at 672). I was shocked, and when I looked at the credit reports, dismayed to realize that the last payment to NMAC didn't get made, and that the account was 90 days past due. The story from NMAC is that the last payment doesn't get made automatically, even if you have an ACH payment set up.

That's not how it's ever worked for us with auto loans in the past, though all of our other auto loans have been through Pentagon Federal Credit Union. PFCU just takes the last payment, and sends a nice letter saying thank you, and then forwards the title, so this was completely unexpected with NMAC.

This is all our own fault (paperless statements, bad email address, not keeping tabs on that bank account, etc.) but I'm just wondering if this is normal lender behavior. Knowing the answer might help when I go to ask for a goodwill change to our reports, or attach an explanation statement if the goodwill change never happens.

,CRedit,"Howdy! 

I have been lurking on this sub for a long time and really appreciate everyone who contributes here. It has helped shape my thinking financially for the better along with a few other subs over the past 2-3 years.

I have been actively working on improving my credit the last 5 months and it’s working, it’s becoming quite fun to see the score rise. 

I’m now moving onto tackling the blemishes on my credit report and one in particular I’m looking for advice with is below. 

It’s an old Wells Fargo “College Credit Card” I received when I was in school and did well with it but once I got into a little bit of a financial tight squeeze, I completely neglected it. Stupid but it is what it is and I’m looking correct it now. 

I just pulled my credit report this morning to start this process and find out what I need to address — here’s what it says under the Wells Fargo Credit Card entry... 

Potentially Negative 

Account Name: WF CRD SVC
Account Type: Credit Card 
Date Opened: 12/31/2008

Status: Account charged off. $500 written off. $500 past due as of July 2020. 

Status Updated: July 14, 2020

Balance: $500
Credit Limit: $700
Highest Balance: $925

On Record Until: Feb 2021


Questions:

1. Does it still look like Wells Fargo is holding the debt? Or was it sold to a collection agency?

2. The status is confusing to me. Can you help decipher that, can it be charged off, written off and still have a past due balance at the same time? 

3. On record until Feb 2021, does that mean it would fall of then? 

4. If Wells Fargo still holds the debt, what are the odds I could pay it off and reopen the account? Is it likely they would do that and would it be beneficial to my credit score more so then letting it fall off or just paying it off? 

5. Would love any info on maybe other angles or general thoughts on my situation I haven’t mentioned.

I was very generously gifted $ to pay off the loan in full recently. Now that the loan paid off, what options to I have, if any, to have those delinquencies removed from my report?

Is this a case where a Goodwill Letter for late payment removal might work?

&lt;p&gt;Even on their website it says that most negative information stays on for 7 years. And the only thing that stays on for 10 is closed accounts that are paid as agreed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyways assist with the next steps?&lt;/p&gt;

**They all impact each and every one of us.**

Some may be called a consumer reporting agency vs credit reporting agency, but they are essentially the same thing.  They report much of the same information and in many cases much more than the big 3.  Many of them maintain separate credit scoring models as well.

Updated the sidebar to include four of the more common ones: Innovis, SageStream, ChexSystems, and PRBC.  There are many, many more however.  Also noteworthy is [LexisNexis](https://consumer.risk.lexisnexis.com/consumer).

Here are some things to know about these other bureaus:

1. You think dealing with the big 3 is a pain? You haven't seen anything yet.  It is extremely frustrating dealing with these other bureaus.  Especially for freezes (they hate that, because that means less money for them).  Expect to do everything by mail, multiple times, with a lot of sorry we can't validate your identity excuses.
2. Some of them get **WAY** more data than you realize.  Go pull your LexisNexis reports and be surprised what they have on you that is not directly related to credit but used for all sorts of modeling and marketing.
3. The love the fact everyone ignores them or don't even know they exist.  You should manage them as much if not even more closely than the big 3.
4. Many of their reports / scores can dramatically impact things such as insurance rates in some states so ignoring them can cost you a lot of money you didn't realize.  They are used in banking, background checks, insurance, traditional credit, rental checks and other areas.
5. Their scoring systems are not nearly as well known and can behave dramatically differently from FICO / Vantage.  Have a 750+ FICO / Vantage score? Well your score from one of these might be mid 400s and with very little information around on how to improve it.
6. They all fall under the same FRCA regulation so your rights with them are the same with the big 3. You have the right to ensure they have correct information and the right to dispute it (be prepared though, see #1).
7. There are many ""sub"" reports such as a CLUE report from LexisNexis which is used for accident claims.  Errors on these can cost you significant amount of money and you need to monitor them as well.

,CRedit,"So my husband and I have been working very hard to rebuild our credit this year in hopes of buying a house next spring. We thought everything was going good, however this week we tried buying a truck (mostly to get me on the lease to help my score out) and even though according to his FICO (fico 8 from Discover) and credit karma he’s at 650-710 on his credit scores, wherever they pulled from showed him at a mid-500 score! 

We passed on the truck because it’s not a necessity right now, but now I’m curious and worried, how will we ever know when our credit is finally good enough to buy a house? Will we keep saving and saving and working on our credit scores for years to finally be ready then get our dreams dashed because some random score from god knows where shows us at 500 instead of 700?

,CRedit,"Hello. Hoping for some advice for the best route for cleaning up the financial mess I've made.

Hopefully you're up for a little back story:
6 years ago I was in a very toxic relationship with a heroin addict. I fell down the rabbit hole with him and my life basically bottomed out. Although I've since ditched the deadbeat and have been clean for almost 4 years now, I am still paying for some poor financial decisions I made while with him. We opened some credit cards (in my name of course 🤦‍♀️) and in 2016 everything fell apart. We broke up, I lost my job and could no longer pay rent on my apartment. He went to rehab paid for by the state, meanwhile I had to move back in with my dad and detox cold turkey. Apparently I had too much money to qualify for any state assistance, funny how that works out. Not that I believe in drug rehab anyway but I digress... 

Fast forward to today and I'm so very blessed to finally be in a healthy relationship with a man I love and trust and who is responsible. I'd like to marry him someday but I would never want to muddy his name with my poor credit. This man loves me and I really don't wanna screw it up... In fact, he bought us a house and even put my name on the title. Don't worry, he knows ALL the skeletons in my closet! 

Some important points:

-I lost my job not even a month after we moved in due to stupid covid :( My income is a little bit of unemployment I get as well as selling on Ebay (which I'd like to keep on the low) 

-My credit score is currently 630-640 (some bot just told me to edit this to where I am getting my FICO. I have Credit Karma and was able to print my reports from Transunion, Equifax and Experian I thought these were the 3 main bureaus? anyway... ) I had to claim bankruptcy after 2008's lovely fiasco and it's due to fall off my credit next month.  

-I'm currently being sued by Midland Funding for a measly $882. This prompted me to get my credit report and finally take a look at the full extent of the damage. 

-Right now I see 6 accounts that are charged off, totaling just over 15K. So far, only 2 of those accounts are in collections, both debts that Midland bought (shysters!)

I also have some current debt which reflects well on my reports since I've tried very hard to learn better financial hygiene lol I owe:

$4700 to Santander for my car loan (got it at a very low interest rate of 2% before I wrecked my good standing)

$1700 on a credit union Visa that's probably around 14%

$2000 to my uncle for basically paying all the fees to bail my dumb ass out of a drug induced DWI.. try driving down the freeway when you're ASLEEP... I can't believe I'm even alive sometimes.. 

$1800 on a Home Depot card (it's my bfs account, he just put me as an authorized user to try and help me rebuild my credit 

I half heartedly started to repair (or at least prevent further damages) to my credit report about 2 years ago which included paying for 2 beaten up apartments I had while with the above loser. (Honestly I was the loser for ever allowing someone to f#$% up my life so royally) Oddly enough I don't see that those were ever even reported on my credit 🤔 So much for trying to be responsible 

So in total that's over 20 grand. It has been a long and sometimes very stressful climb out of that deep dark hole... and I'm still just trying to make things right. 

On a good note, I've managed to save up $7600 which is the most I've ever saved. I am wondering what the best use of this money would be. Since the pandemic I've had a lot of time on my hands so bought some books on finance and personal improvements. I wanted to siphon off this $ for a little bit while I figure out my next career move because I was really unhappy at my last job... in fact, work induced stress is a huge trigger for me to use, it's why I tried heroin in the first place. I really don't want to get another soul killing corporate gig... I was SO looking forward to getting my ducks in a row and possibly even investing so I could make my money grow and have something to fall back on later in life. I have major depression with 2 suicide attempts under my belt which I am not proud of but the thought of going back to corporate america drudgery makes me wish I WAS dead. 

I'm sorry for the freaking life story novel here jesus.... just trying to paint a picture of what life looks like for me right now.  

I'd really rather avoid another BK seeing as how freaking HARD I've been trying to finally get it together in life and doing that would be like flushing it all down the toilet. I realize that even though some of the charged off accounts aren't currently in collections, it doesn't mean they won't be in the future. With that said, it's been about 4 years since they saw a pmt from me and my states statute of limitations is 6.. so maybe they could fall off on their own? 

I really do want to take responsibility but I'm losing a lot of sleep and it's all just so emotionally draining... 

As for the lawsuit, I answered the complaint so as to not get a default judgment. I know the burden of proof lies with Midland so I'm basically forcing their hand and asking them to validate the debt. They sent me a bunch of old statements. I'm not trying to say the debt isn't mine but there is no signature and IF they sent me a letter of intent to sue I didn't get it. Isnt that in itself a violation?? I think it is SO corrupt that these junk debt buyers get away with what they do.. SO many people are suffering because they are ethically bankrupt.  

Yes, I COULD pay it from my savings BUT I'm worried that if I make a large pmt on ANYTHING right now it will bite me later. Will other lawsuits pop up if any of the other creditors see if I settle with Midland?? I am aware that any debt over $600 is considered a gain and will be taxed so I'm thinking of offering $300 to try and put a stop to this... but what if they refuse and try and seize my bank account? 

I guess my final question is, what should I do with my 7K? Take it out?? I'm growing quite distrustful in ANY financial institution anyway. My bf said he would hold my money for me if I want.. 

Maybe I should just pay my car off? Or be proactive and just try to pay as much on old debt as I can? How do I even find out who owns the other charged off accounts?? I would like to prevent further lawsuits while I get my life figured out!! 

I'm so tired of feeling overwhelmed. It's like 2 steps forward and 10 back... this has been a LONG 4 years to try and make things ""right"". Bleh just throw me in debtors prison and get it over with 🙄

I'm looking to apply for a mortgage sometime in mid 2021 and I want to have the highest FICO score possible.

I got a capital one secured card back in March 2020 to start rebuilding my credit.  I was just bumped from my original 301$ limit to 601$.

I recently paid off a 742$ collection from LVNV funding for a credit one card I defaulted on and it should be removed in the next month or so.  Hoping that should raise my score decently since LVNV reported every month so there is unpaid collection entries for the past like 7-8months since they bought it.

On a whim I tried the capital one prequalify link and saw I now pre-qualify for the unsecured platinum card as well as the quicksilver one card.

,CRedit,"I recently had a problem with my creditor report due to an outstanding collections account. I followed some of the advice on Reddit and decided to send dispute letters via certified mail to the three credit bureaus. After a few weeks, I received my first response from Equifax stating that the debt had been verified, and that it would be kept on my credit report going further.

2) Focus on paying off the existing account with ERC first.

,CRedit,"I recently received the money to pay of my car and student loans early. However after a bit of research I found out that doing so would negatively impact my credit.

If I paid both of my only debt left would be my mortgage and apparently having a single line of credit out can negatively impact your score, even it is because you proved that you can pay off other debts.

So I thought I'd out smart the system and prepaid and large portion of both my car and student loans so that they balance isn't $0 but my next payments aren't due for several years.

So my question, by keeping a small balance (interest will be pennies, aka not a concern if it accrues over a couple years) does this actually help maintain my credit better than having paid them off completely, since it would show a diversified lending portfolio?

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I&amp;#39;d out smart the system and prepaid and large portion of both my car and student loans so that they balance isn&amp;#39;t $0 but my next payments aren&amp;#39;t due for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question, by keeping a small balance (interest will be pennies, aka not a concern if it accrues over a couple years) does this actually help maintain my credit better than having paid them off completely, since it would show a diversified lending portfolio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: not sure if this would play a factor but I&amp;#39;m 27 and my score is currently in the 810-820 range&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Throwaway account because reasons...

5 years and a half ago, I financed a new car for 23k at 0%. I had some trouble with credit as a young adult, so I was both happy and surprised to be offered 0% financing! One thing I didn't expect is that I was also offered a 14k CC on top of it. Now, I know you'll never be offered credit when you actually need it, I thought ""why not?""... It was a Visa, I only had an MC at the time and the interest rate was really low, like 11.99%. 

Well, let's say the bank made up that 0% and then some. Next thing I knew, the balance started creeping up. I would make purchases and wouldn't pay it back right away. Before long, the old habit of not looking at my statements came back...

Forward to September 2018. My GF and I were trying for a baby and what do you know, the stick turned blue! Quite the life changer, that's for sure... So now, realizing the predicament I'm about to find myself in, I dare to look at my CC statements and boy, am I in for a rude awakening! Turns out I dug myself a 13k hole!!! Do I need to tell you I had a hard time sleeping at night? I would literally spend the night tossing and turning, thinking about how the hell I'd manage to get out of this... I swear, I would get in my car and all I'd hear on the radio was bankruptcy trustee ads.

Now, I was making around 60k at the time, still renting at 34, but I did have some extra money at the end of the month. So I started by paying the lowest balance one, which also had the highest interest rate. Debt snowball/avalanche combo, sweet! I was also paying the minimum on the second one, even throwing an extra 200-300$ here and there.

About a year later, I got a promotion at work, taking me to 70k. And just like that, more money to put towards debt! 

My son was born in June 2019 and we were very lucky to have been gifted a lot of baby stuff. Also, my GF was breastfeeding, so our baby's first year didn't cost us much really. Being Canadians, we are blessed with great maternity leave benefits + child benefits, so our financial situation was even better then before! On top of that, as new parents, we basically didn't have any social life anymore. Gone were the days of movie dates or going to the restaurant! Again, more money to put towards debt!

Now, things were going pretty well, then this little thing called COVID-19 hits. I have to say we were some of the lucky ones! See, I work in insurance, so I remained employed all this time, working from home! Still, I had over 7k left to pay, so a long way off regardless. At this point my first CC was down to 0, so all of my extra money goes to the other one.

Luckily, my yearly bonus came in just before COVID, so I put that towards the remaining CC balance. As much as I would have liked to treat myself to something nice, feeling hopeful about climbing out of debts felt like reward enough!

Funny thing about COVID is that it really made me frugal. I would think of buying something on Amazon or something, leave it in my cart and come back to it a few days later, thinking about how I don't really need it. Also, this lockdown thing meant no more visiting my family (gas, food, activities). So there you go, even more money to put towards debt!

These past 3 months, I really went all in and paid between 1 and 1,5k each month. I saw the balance drop really quickly, which has been insanely satisfying! 

And here I am now, with just under a little under 1k to go. Also, my car is almost finished paying, so I'm about to be completely debt-free! Best of all, now that I'm not going to be throwing all my extra money at CC debt, I'll start saving extra fast towards a downpayment for a house! It really is an amazing feeling, like a huge load has been taken off!

In case you're also wondering, my credit scores are also pretty decent, between 750 and 800. Those aren't FICO's because we Canadians can't get them. Only lenders can and they will tell you your score if you ask.

So here are my takeaways :

1- Limit your spending... 

I know, it goes without saying but I got into debt for a reason. I was spending carelessly without paying it back (more on that later).

2- Increase your income. 

I was lucky to get that promotion and the bonus. If you don't have such luck, find yourself a second job, but earning more really is the key and it made a HUGE difference for me!

3- Whatever you do, DON'T STICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND! 

Or if you do, wake up! Whoever said time heals all things clearly never got into CC debt! Check your statements monthly. Check your credit report monthly. Set-up payment reminders and alerts. I sleepwalked my way into debt, but paying it back took a lot of conscious efforts.

4- This one is optional, but still important IMO. Learn to use credit responsibly. 

It's ok to use your credit card for regular purchases. I've been using mine for online purchases and stuff, but I make sure to pay it back by the end of the month. Just like someone coming out of a diet will often put back the weight, you risk falling into the same traps if you don't learn new behaviors. I know a lot of people say you should cut your cards or freeze them in an ice block or something, but I think you're better off learning from your mistakes instead.

,CRedit,"On 11/2018 I had a 530 FICO credit score. Today all my scores are over a 760. Of course there are some pretty obvious reasons as the old negatives were close to 7 years old when I began (and have since fallen off) so any new credit with responsibility since then immediately began pushing my score up. I was over a 700 before the old even fell off.

I used 2 secure credit cards and a retail installment loan place called Conn's so I had 3 different places reporting my progress. The 2 secured credit cards have since become unsecured (normal) credit cards. They were/ are a Citi Mastercard and a Discover card. I use my Citi for my gas only and my Discover card for EVERYTHING else I can. This amounts to around 20%-30% of my credit utilization rate though I pay the balance off in full several times a month to insure it is never too high at any given time. 

Anyways, as to my post title, the Discover card has a 1% cashback reward (on specified purchases that I regularly purchase anyways groceries, goods, etc). This only amounts to maybe $20-$30 a month cashback, but in paying my balance off in full, and never being charged interest in the process, I am able to apply my 1% cashback reward towards my principal balance thereby reducing the overall price (principal amount) of every single purchase I make every month. So while I am building and solidifying a solid credit score I am simultaneously using the same tools to reduce my overall monthly expenditure, thereby increasing my savings over and above my budget. These are purchases I would be making anyways even without my card, but in using my card I end up reducing the averaged price of everything I purchase with or without the card as I get money back over and above my monthly budget that I would not have created without the card.

,CRedit,"In the United States, and around the world, being able to get better opportunities depends on the credit score you have. Credit scores are used when applying for certain jobs, to rent or buy a home, when buying something on credit like a car or a cell phone, opening an account to get Internet connectivity, or getting utility services. Lower prices and interest rates are given to people with better credit scores. This system keeps the poor, poor. It ensures that people who do not have a good credit score cannot get access to the same prime services reserved for those who do, generally those with more money. In the United States, the credit score of one spouse can affect the other.
If the system was fair, lower interests and prices would be given to the people with lower scores who are generally poorer, to help them make their payments on time while giving them access to the same buying power and services those with money and good credit score can get. But the credit system failed its purpose: to put people on the same level regardless of social differences when scoring their creditworthiness. The credit system is set up to be a collective legal way of economic discrimination that rewards the rich. When credit scores are used in hiring and salary decisions, using credit score data and social characteristics can disproportionally affect women and black applicants. According to Rourke L. O’Brien and Barbara Kiviat's research paper ""Disparate Impact? Race, Sex, and Credit Reports in Hiring"", ""Part of the promise of employers’ using seemingly objective information like what is contained in credit reports is that by basing hiring decisions on person-specific information, the influence of sex, race, and other social categories will be minimized. Our survey experiment shows how the inclusion of such information can actually accentuate social differences, not eliminate them. When we included credit reports among other job-application materials, the hiring outcomes of female and black applicants changed relative to those of men and whites, with bad credit doing more to hurt the prospects of both women and blacks, in terms of recommendation to hire and starting salary."" 
The plight for equality for minorities of color and women starts here. The legal system is already set up to deal with people who do not pay as agreed. We do not need a system that is set up to perpetuate financial social discrimination. This is the systemic racial practices the current movement needs to change.

,CRedit,"I do not have any debt and never borrow money. I have two credit cards and I pay them off every month. My credit score has been over 800-900 for 10+ years.

I typically don't care much about my credit score as I don't borrow large sums of money. All my vehicles are paid for with cash. We are looking to purchase a house in the next year so my credit score's importance has shifted a bit as it is a factor to get a mortgage.

This morning I got an alert from creditwise that there was a change and my score dropped by 142 points. Below are the two changes that have occurred on the accounts.

1. I had a $36k credit limit that dropped to $500. This was on my longest active CC. I hadn't used it in years so I just figured they figured why bother giving this guy all this credit.
2. That same credit card got charged twice by two places that rarely ever send me bills. I had no idea the charges had come and didn't pay them for over two months.

I'm a private wealth member of this bank where I hold deposits accounts, savings accounts, and this credit card.

It was clearly my fault but I feel like there should be some goodwill when they look at how much money I carry with them and my history. I would have paid it if I had seen these charges. I got zero notification that I had an overdue bill.

,CRedit,"Someone said to me last year - you really should have cash-back or something as you run a lot of charges through your cards (I used to travel A LOT before COVID) so I got a Discover IT card with cashback, which was sort of a half-assed attempt to switch to all cash-back cards.

I then called my Bank who issued my AMEX and asked if there was a cash-back card....after much discussion the answer was no.

I've had a capital one platinum whatever card for ten years now. I've had one limit increase during that time and its not really a thing that I think much about...after talking to my bank about my AMEX I thought I would call Cap-One and see if I could ""switch"" - experienced a long hold time on the call and I hung up - talking to them about it fell off my radar.

Today, I get an email from them saying:

*Thank you for being a Capital One® cardmember. We’re pleased with your track record, and we’d like to recognize your loyalty with an exclusive offer to apply and earn 1.5% cash back on purchases.*

*It’s confirmed! You’re now eligible to apply for a new Quicksilver® Mastercard® from Capital One® because of how responsibly you’ve used your existing Capital One credit card. Once approved...blah, blah, blah...*

(I get the ""buy a car!!"" emails from them all the time and delete them)

Does this mean that they want me to get a Quicksilver card in addition to my regular card? Swap them out? I don't really know what this means but it has renewed my interest in moving over to all cash-back cards.

## 				  

 

Long story short, I am in the process of buying a house. I have  5 disputes that are over a year old.  They are no longer active, but  the remarks from the investigation is left.

I have a 2017 model Ford with less than 54Kmiles EX edition with all the bells and whistles appraised by PenFed at $31.6K blue book. 

Original loan $26.5k with Capital One 9.5% APR. I pay and additional $50-100 per month towards the principal making this a pricey loan I want to pay down faster. My note is $471.34 and PenFed offered me a 3.4% used car rate. 

My current loan balance is $20k with a 10 day payoff. The loan officer said everything looked good. Today I received a denial saying “Bill obligations not met. Length of time unknown”


The only derogatory on my Eq is a medical bill that isn’t mine and keeps popping up due to another person with same name. It’s been removed 4xs. Also I had a late payment on an old closed guitar center account due to them not updating my address in 2015 but I have a 100% payment history and own a home with equity. 

In addition to the Ford loan I have a 2nd vehicle financed with Capital One. Both loans are paid on time with early payoff. 

Has anyone had success with reconsideration with PenFed? They didn’t even ask for a co-signer or ask for additional options to push the refinance through. Seems odd as it’s secured by a vehicle they appraise and verified.

,CRedit,"Hi all - I could really use any advice you have to offer because I made a big mistake and I’m destroyed by anxiety right now. 

So the backstory is that I am a year into postdoc life after 7 years of grad school, and during the last part of those seven years I racked up a lot of credit card debt (I knoooowww I should have been more responsible but I was making basically poverty wages and really struggling to meet basic needs so ... credit cards). I guess not a LOT relative speaking but it feels crushing to me ($1000 on a credit union, $1500 on a discover it unsecured and $3000 on a bank of america travel rewards). Anyway now that I’ve been in postdoc I’ve been steadily trying to pay these down but my postdoc doesn’t pay very well and I live in a very expensive city and also have student loans so it’s been really slow going. I knew my credit was being hurt by high utilization but was doing my best to chip away and never missing payments etc and last I checked I was hovering in the mid 600s. 

Flash forward to today when I decide to check my score (whatever the free fico score check that Discover gives you) and noticed that my score has just dipped into the poor range at 579 and I was shocked and couldn’t figure out why! I finally discovered the culprit: a few months ago, my bank of america card upped its monthly minimum payment for me (it was $40 a month and I was paying $100, they upped it to $140) and I never got any notification of it. I’m signed up for estatements and notifications but because I was still paying a monthly fee it never registered as late - I was just underpaying for four months. (and I know this is terrible but I didn’t read the statement each month - I don’t use the card and figured I was just slowly chipping away). Anyway it has now registered as four missed months of payments and they closed the card. I called in a panic when I realized and they said they couldn’t do anything since I did obviously underpay and therefore missed payments - and they’re right. Obviously I would love to just pay it all off right now but that would pretty much demolish the meager savings I’ve slowly built up with the aim of having a down payment for a new (used) car this year. I took $1200 from savings to pay off as much as I could now but that still leaves a little under $1800 and a demolished credit score. Plus my other credit cards and student loans etc. And I guess no chance of getting a halfway decent used car. 

Anyway I’m so angry with myself and also embarrassed; I feel like I’ve been trying so hard to pull myself out (slowly!!!) of bad financial habits and now I’m an idiot with a terrible credit score. And not a lot of financial literacy. So reddit ... I could really use any guidance you have for me.

&lt;p&gt;They both just got denied for a store card at a local furniture place because I they stupidly applied after I told them not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there higher rate lenders for this type of credit? I would advise them to maybe go with a slightly hire than market rate for a year and then refinance if they can.&lt;/p&gt;

After months of no reporting, Ally reported 2 late payments incorrectly for January and February 2020 (we have paid on time, every time). Credit score went down dramatically in May, thus rendering me no longer able to get a mortgage. We were aiming to buy this month.

I disputed via CK on the TU account in June and that came back closed as apparently Ally ""confirmed"" the incorrect info 30 days later.

,CRedit,"Hello 
So my fico experian score recently dropped by 40 points. I have one credit card that I pay every month on time and in full. I've has this card for about two years now and try to keep a 3% utilization. Last month I  didn’t spend much on my credit card so I had a 0% utilization. I have one student loan that is not in collections. I am paying on that every month. I didn’t open any new accounts. The last account that was closed was last year. 

My other scores didn't change (based on vantage and fico 9). 

Would anyone know why my credit score dropped so low? I have the free version of the Experian report so I can only check that one from the site. I also use credit karma to check my other reports. I don’t have any changes or anything that looks suspicious. 
I think it might be from my lack of spending/credit usage for this period but I want to get opinions. I didn’t think my score would drop so low because of low activity.

,CRedit,"So about a month ago I had posted about an incorrect balance being reported on all 3 bureau reports.

I had an old Barclay Mastercard account from 2016, that was sent to collections in 2017.

The account was transferred to LTD Financial, which is the collection agency.

I paid off the balance of $1900, within 2 months, and I have the bank statements to prove it.

With that being said, I called Barclay and they told me that the collection agency has the responsibility of updating the bureau's once the account is paid in full.

They also offered to send me a letter confirming that the account was in fact at a $0 balance. 

With everything going on with the USPS, I have yet to receive that letter, almost a month later.

However, I do have the bank statements. Would that be enough to submit as proof if I submit a dispute to the agencies? Or should I wait to see if the letter from Barclay pops up?

,CRedit,"Like many on this board, I’m in the process of fixing my credit and hoping to qualify for a mortgage within the next 6 months. I only have two collection accounts (two different credit cards, both with Portfolio Recovery) which are now about 5-6 years old. One will be outside the statute of limitations in my state within 4 months, and the other still has about a year left before being out of SOL. The total of both collections combined is just over $3,000. The debts are mine and I know they are hurting my scores because of the monetary amount being calculated towards my debt as well as being the only two collection accounts I have. I’m in a much better financial situation now and would be able to pay them if it means getting them off my report.

My question is how to go about this? I have heard Portfolio will often do a pay for delete and often for a smaller amount than what is owed. I don’t want to restart the statute by simply offering to pay and acknowledging the debt but I’m assuming if I dispute any of this through the credit bureaus it will poke the bear and they’ll reach out wanting the money anyways. I have not heard anything from the collection agency in years, I believe the last contact was a settlement offer back in 2016.

I’m also hoping to strengthen my score by paying down my student loans to less than half of what is owed since I only owe $5,000 or so now (the only other debt I have on my credit report) and also getting a credit card and making small payments to improve my credit utilization portion of the score.

&lt;p&gt;Let this be an opportunity for everyone to learn from my mistake...&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"New here so sorry for breaking rules.

I have good credit but that's because I'm afraid to use it and petrified of ruining it.  Hoping you guys can help me understand if using my credit will dramatically effect it.

Fico: 808/792  (Experian/Bank of America)  
Vatange 3.0: 761  (Credit Karma)  
Average History: 5.5/5.1 years$3,500 of available credit over 2 credit cards (paid off every month after they are reported to CK), the rest are student/auto loans.

Goal - want to apply for new credit but need to preserve my score.  In the 12-18 months, I want to purchase a house so maintaining a good score is 100% necessary.  (co-signor of house will only have \~680 Score).

What I want to do with my credit today

1. Refinance $50k in student loans.  Currently paying 7.1% and was quoted at 4.08% for a lesser term.
2. Apply for the citi double cash card for better rewards.  I'm approved via CK so I doubt it will deny. If this one is a no-go, I'm completely fine with it, just tell me!

Questions:

1. Will refinancing my loans hurt me because it's going to affect my average credit age?  I will be closing a 38 month account and opening a brand new one with a $50k balance.  This is going to save me nearly $100 a month without increasing the term, so I really feel like that's worth it but if saving $1,200.00 over 1 year is going to impact my house purchasing goal, I'm not sure it's worth it.
2. Similar fear of Credit age, I want to open a new credit card and close a 26 month old Bank of America Card that offers less rewards.

Bonus Question:  Should I put my fiancee as a cosigner on the Citi CC?  CK score is \~680 (she's on time with everything, her credit is just too new).  Would this increase her score or decrease mine?  Is this a wise choice prior to house purchasing or would it be better to wait for the house?

,CRedit,"Hi guys,

I am confused about when to pay my credit card bill to optimize my score.

My due date is always on the 16th, but my statement date is different every month, usually somewhere between the 19-21st.  I’ve noticed that what affects the credit score is whatever the balance is on the statement date.  This month, my statement is on the 21st.

I always pay my credit card in full every month.  Last month, I paid in full on the due date of the 16th, however, by the time the statement date rolled around (I think on the 21st), I had already spent $500 more, and it made my credit score go down because the utilization was too high! Shouldn’t I be rewarded with an addition of points if I paid on my due date?

My question is: when do I pay to optimize my score (TransUnion &amp; Equifax on Credit Karma) and have my utilization close to 0% on the statement date? This month, I plan on skipping the due date and waiting till the 20th to pay everything off, so by the 21st, the utilization will be close to 0%, making my score go up.  But in afraid if I skip the due date of the 16th, I will get punished for it.  I also don’t want to have to pay more than once a month because that is tedious and annoying.

What should I do?

,CRedit,"Long story short back in 2015 my company failed and I pretty much neglected my credit entirely. I was racking up expenses and just put everything on my credit cards...until I ran out of credit and ran out of money and sort of adopted the mindset that credit is just a number until I could get back on my feet.

Anyways, I'm in a much better financial position today and have some savings to resolve my past debts. However, I want to do it in a way that best resolves my credit issue too because not having credit cards, not being able to get a car loan, mortgage, etc sucks.

Here are my accounts that show up on my credit report as charge offs/closed, date of last payment was Dec 2015/Jan 2016 for all of them:

* AMEX -2.4k
* AMEX - 9
* AMEX - 3.3k
* BoA - 2k
* Discover - 5.2k
* Chase - 4.4k
* Chase - 5k
* Chase - 2.3k
* Syncb - Paid, was charge-off. Last update 2016
* Toyota Motors - Paid, 9 late payments. Last update 2017

Here are the ones that are listed as collections:

* Portfolio Recovery (Cap1): 2.4k
* Cavalry (citi): 7k
* Portfolio Recovery (Cap1): 531
* Portfolio Recovery (synchrony): 2.5k

I have 2 active secured credit cards. With 800 limit a piece and pretty much just $10 balance.

Here's my game plan, and I'm hoping to see if you guys can go over and offer any advice or what you would do differently.

I have $35k in savings right now and I'm trying to resolve it without wiping out my entire savings. Maybe $20k?

My plan's to tackle the collections first. I was going to offer the collections a reduced balance in exchange for delete or a settlement for less to show as paid in full. I have in writing from Cavalry that they will take 50% to satisfy the account in full, and I have 60 days to pay. Portfolio Recovery has not contacted me since 2017. So I was going to offer them 30% to satisfy all accounts in full.

I've been told that I should considering paying off Amex and Discover in full, as they're more forgiving for future cards? I know they have the highest limits. Amex has sent me settlement letters for months, I doubt any of the companies above will do pay for delete. A friend of mines told me I to ask AMEX for their bad credit card in return for full payoff, he did it during a bankruptcy in 2008 and eventually they moved him back up to a normal card and gave him preapproval for more. I think it's worth wild to not get blackballed by AMEX, anyone with experience?

Discover has not contacted me for years. Personally don't really care for discover. I was going to reach out and offer them 30% to resolve and work up from there.

BoA has sent me countless emails to settle for 30%, so I was thinking of just taking up their offer.

Chase...that's one I'd like to know more about. They've offered to settle at around 40%, but at the same time their cards have really good benefits and I'd like to eventually sign up for another one. The thing is do they black ball like AMEX?

My understanding is the collections are hitting my credit the hardest right now and that I should resolve those first since they go away once paid right? At least if negotiated that way.

Given the age of the delinquencies, does it matter if they are charge off settle vs paid in full? It doesn't impact the score right? Just credit worthiness in a manual review?

Ultimately my #1 priority is credit for credit cards and auto loan/lease. I'm trying to expand my new business and I have several contracts that will keep me real busy for the next 2-3 years at the very least, and I need the some kind of revolving credit. The points would be a cherry on top since I will have having inventory coming in and out. I'd like to eventually buy a 2nd house for rental purposes, so my credit will be manually reviewed, but I don't plan buy another until at least 2022 that way at least I have a lot more confidence about my current contracts and all my charge offs are set to fall off around that time.

My Experian fico8 score is 530 right now. Credit.com has my vantage 3 at 535-540. I'm hoping to bring my score up to 650-680. It seems doable since I do have some ability to pay right?

,CRedit,"Long story short back in 2015 my company failed and I pretty much neglected my credit entirely. I was racking up expenses and just put everything on my credit cards...until I ran out of credit and ran out of money and sort of adopted the mindset that credit is just a number until I could get back on my feet.

Anyways, I'm in a much better financial position today and have some savings to resolve my past debts. However, I want to do it in a way that best resolves my credit issue too because not having credit cards, not being able to get a car loan, mortgage, etc sucks.

Here are my accounts that show up on my credit report as charge offs/closed, date of last payment was Dec 2015/Jan 2016 for all of them:

* AMEX -2.4k
* AMEX - 9k
* AMEX - 3.3k
* BoA - 2k
* Discover - 5.2k
* Chase - 4.4k
* Chase - 5k
* Chase - 2.3k
* Syncb - Paid, was charge-off. Last update 2016
* Toyota Motors - Paid, 9 late payments. Last update 2017

Here are the ones that are listed as collections:

* Portfolio Recovery (Cap1): 2.4k
* Cavalry (citi): 7k
* Portfolio Recovery (Cap1): 531
* Portfolio Recovery (synchrony): 2.5k 

I have 2 active secured credit cards. With 800 limit a piece and pretty much just $10 balance.

Here's my game plan, and I'm hoping to see if you guys can go over and offer any advice or what you would do differently. 

I have $35k in savings right now and I'm trying to resolve it without wiping out my entire savings. Maybe $20k?

My plan's to tackle the collections first. I was going to offer the collections a reduced balance in exchange for delete or a settlement for less to show as paid in full. I have in writing from Cavalry that they will take 50% to satisfy the account in full, and I have 60 days to pay. Portfolio Recovery has not contacted me since 2017. So I was going to offer them 30% to satisfy all accounts in full. 

I've been told that I should considering paying off Amex and Discover in full, as they're more forgiving for future cards? I know they have the highest limits. Amex has sent me settlement letters for months, I doubt any of the companies above will do pay for delete. A friend of mines told me I to ask AMEX for their bad credit card in return for full payoff, he did it during a bankruptcy in 2008 and eventually they moved him back up to a normal card and gave him preapproval for more. I think it's worth wild to not get blackballed by AMEX, anyone with experience? 

Discover has not contacted me for years. Personally don't really care for discover. I was going to reach out and offer them 30% to resolve and work up from there. 

BoA has sent me countless emails to settle for 30%, so I was thinking of just taking up their offer. 

Chase...that's one I'd like to know more about. They've offered to settle at around 40%, but at the same time their cards have really good benefits and I'd like to eventually sign up for another one. The thing is do they black ball like AMEX? 

My understanding is the collections are hitting my credit the hardest right now and that I should resolve those first since they go away once paid right? At least if negotiated that way. 

Given the age of the delinquencies, does it matter if they are charge off settle vs paid in full? It doesn't impact the score right? Just credit worthiness in a manual review? 

Ultimately my #1 priority is credit for credit cards and auto loan/lease. I'm trying to expand my new business and I have several contracts that will keep me real busy for the next 2-3 years at the very least, and I need the some kind of revolving credit. The points would be a cherry on top since I will have having inventory coming in and out. I'd like to eventually buy a 2nd house for rental purposes, so my credit will be manually reviewed, but I don't plan buy another until at least 2022 that way at least I have a lot more confidence about my current contracts and all my charge offs are set to fall off around that time.

,CRedit,"Hi!

My very first car, a 2012 Chevy Cruze, has recently been having expensive issues (i.e. I've paid $4,500 to fix this car in the past 8 months) and I am seriously considering getting a new one (if I can get approved). 

The caveat is that I just ""bought"" a car for my fiance in April, although he has been making the monthly payments with his own money.

,CRedit,"About me
Background: Back in 2014, I had clawed out of college/post-college credit irresponsibility to get to a pretty decent credit score, but following some extended underemployment followed by personal issues intermingled with rash financial decisions/more credit irresponsibility, I had tanked my credit scores into the mid-400s by 2018. Well, I've spent the last year trying to claw back out of the hole again, but I still have a ways to go.

Age: 35

Income: $60,000

Rent: $0 - live with parents

Goal: get back to good credit standing, buy a house


Current credit situation

FICO 8 scores (from Experian):

EX 674

EQ 677

TU 667

 

5 Open Accounts

3 Revolving accounts (utilization currently at 1%)

Indigo MC, $300 CL, Opened 12/2019

Credit One Platinum Visa $300 CL, Opened 1/2020

Mission Lane Visa, $750 CL, Opened 8/2020

2 Installment accounts

1 Auto Loan First Investor Financial, Opened 8/2020 (just refinanced), 13% APR, Balance: $16,000, 72 months remaining, Monthly Payment $334

1 Secured Savings Loan through my CU, Opened 6/2020, 3% APR, $2500 balance, 12 months remaining, Monthly payment $212

Main Negatives:

Southeast Toyota Finance, 24 late payments, redeemed repossession, but eventually paid off (when I totaled it 🙄luckily I had GAP)

CapitalOne QuickSilver One, Charged off 9/2017, paid off in full 6/2020

CapitalOne Journey, Charged off 9/2017, paid off in full 4/2020

Discover it, closed around the same time as the CapOne cards, 5 late payments, paid off in full 6/2020

Mercury MC, charged off 6/2018, never paid off because the balance has disappeared off my credit report (aka reports as $0)

-Barclaycard MC, 3 late payments, sold to Mercury Bank 

Mattress Firm/WF, Charged off 9/2017, paid off in settlement 8/2019

 

I also have some older closed store cards (Dillards, Gap, Dell) that show up as either paid as agreed or unknown payment history. (I never used the Dell account and it was closed in 2007. Why is it still showing up??)

 

Questions

1. Where do I go from here? My goal is to raise my credit scores into the 750s. I want to buy a house by end of next year.

2. How do I tackle this Mercury/Barclay balance? It's around $8K but it doesn't appear anywhere on my credit report. Should I just go and pay it off proactively or let it come back before I tackle it? I have about $12k in savings but I'd like to get to $18k so I can pay it off in full and still have $10k saved (banking $1k a month in savings so I'd get there by next March).

3. My car is $6K under water. Should I prioritize getting my car above water to refinance or sell, or saving up the money to pay off the $8k missing Mercury balance?

,CRedit,"Throwaway for this one.

**The Backstory:**

* I took out an auto loan with a 5-year term in June 2014.
* By May of 2018, disruptions in my income had led me to become seriously delinquent; ultimately, the account was closed &amp; charged off by the lender.
* At the time of the chargeoff, my balance was just over $5k. I thought the chargeoff meant I was off the hook for the balance.
* For whatever reason, this chargeoff does *not* appear on either Experian or Credit Karma anymore - in fact, they both list the account as paid in full with no late payments.
* Last status date on this account shows as January 2020 (per Experian).
* Earlier this month, I received a letter from the lender seeking repayment of the remaining $5k, offering me a chance to ""avoid the risk of possible repossession"".

**The Question:**

If I respond to this letter, could that cause:

* The delinquent account details to return to my report?
* The latest status date to be updated?
* A hit to my score?
* Any other negative consequences?

It's been 2 years since the account was closed, and I'd be surprised if they actually repossessed the vehicle now. At the same time, I don't want a repo on my report, and I don't like having this hanging over my head.

In the couple of years since this chargeoff, I've rebuilt my scores from the mid-500s to 700-ish.

Is there any way to resolve this account without taking a hit to my scores?

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys for the last couple of months I’ve been wanting to rebuild my credit in efforts to sometime soon buy a home but I really have no clue how to repair. I wanted to see if someone can help me with a road map. I’ve pulled my credit report from all 3 bureaus and this is where I stand. Any and all help well be appreciated. Thank you guys so much &lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Hi r/credit! After years of spotless credit, I've just discovered my FICO score has dropped by 200 points, into the high 500s, due to an unpaid $500 business expense from February. This was on a Chase business card that I had connected to autopay when I opened it; it's the only thing I ever used it for. I know I connected it to autopay because I connect all my cards to autopay--thus my good credit to date. I never received a letter from Chase, an email from Chase, or a phone call from Chase; they have all of that information from me and contact me regularly about other things. I also logged into my Chase account regularly and had 0 notifications from them. As soon as I found out that this charge was unpaid (tonight!) I paid it off in full (the amount in the linked account more than covered it).

This is definitely partially or even mostly my fault, but it seems at least partly on Chase too. So I guess what I'd love some advice on is:

1. What's my best approach to addressing this?
2. Who do I need to address it with? (The three credit score companies?)
3. Is it possible to receive some clemency based on my previously spotless record?
4. Now that the charge is paid off, how long would you expect this to take to recover? (My other card, with a separate bank, I use for almost everything and pay off in full every month, if that affects anything.)
5. Basically, how screwed am I here?

I know I connected it to autopay because I connect all my cards to autopay--thus my good credit to date. I never received a letter from Chase, an email from Chase, or a phone call from Chase; they have all of that information from me and contact me regularly about other things. I also logged into my Chase account regularly and had 0 notifications from them. As soon as I found out that this charge was unpaid (tonight!) I paid it off in full (the amount in the linked account more than covered it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely partially or even mostly my fault, but it seems at least partly on Chase too. So I guess what I&amp;#39;d love some advice on is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s my best approach to addressing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who do I need to address it with? (The three credit score companies?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to receive some clemency based on my previously spotless record?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that the charge is paid off, how long would you expect this to take to recover? (My other card, with a separate bank, I use for almost everything and pay off in full every month, if that affects anything.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basically, how screwed am I here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any help you can give! I&amp;#39;m stressing, and I honestly just don&amp;#39;t know enough about credit scores to know how to approach this.&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Hi all,

About this time last year I had absolutely terrible credit. It's still pretty bad, but I'm in a much better spot. 

Per Experian (which I've noticed seems kinda inflated but I dunno) I was at **467 in Aug '19.**

**I'm at 615 now.**

I will admit I haven't been as aggressive in rebuilding my credit as I would have liked to have been, but lockdown has allowed me to really take time to sit down and actually plan this out.

I'll be applying for apartments in the Los Angeles area (with a roommate) around April of next year, so I'm trying to make my report look as less crappy as possible.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with these guys/advice on if I should pay these creditors, ask for a Pay for Delete etc. Here's what I'm working with:

* **$375** medical bill from a local ER. ***Collection Opened: Aug 2016***
* **$872** CapitalOne bill. Now with Portfolio Recovery. ***Collection Opened: Aug 2016***
* **$267** balance with CCS.  ***Collection Opened: April 2015***

While in lockdown, I've built up a healthy savings account so I have quite a bit of leverage to negotiate in paying a large percentage of these balances if needed. I understand, however, that may not be very beneficial at this point.

and if i do start contacting them and settling all of these accounts, will that reset the 7 year clock and SOL?

What do you think they will agree on prcentage wise? or what percent on each of these should i offer?

(about $23,500 total i just rounded up all the numbers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question, should i settle these to get a status of paid/settled or should i just let them all fall off in late 2022?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and if i do start contacting them and settling all of these accounts, will that reset the 7 year clock and SOL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think they will agree on prcentage wise? or what percent on each of these should i offer?&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Hello!! 

A little bit of backstory, on June 30th I received an email from the Gold’s Gym location I signed up with that they would be closing &amp; TruFit Gym would be taking over. In the email, they provided me with the TruFit Gym General Manager’s email. Since signing up for Gold’s, I started working about 30 minutes away from where I live, and use the Golds in the city I work in. I’ve never used the gym I originally signed up with, even though it’s close to my house because I go after work. I signed up online so I’ve never even stepped foot in that gym. Upon receiving the email, I immediately emailed the GM at TruFit explaining this, explaining that I’ve already contacted the gym that I use and that they will be moving my home gym to their location so that I can continue to use it. I also asked if there was anything I needed to do to cancel the membership with TruFit &amp; was told “no you do not”. I’ve paid Golds Gym two times since this conversation. 

Today, TruFit is attempting to charge my card. I emailed the GM asking why, and called the billing department at TruFit. They are stating that my membership was never cancelled and if I want to cancel I have to go in and pay the remaining balance.

My Experian FICO score 8 is 539 and currently, utilization is 28% since I had to buy a new laptop since my nephew broke my laptop. Its a BestBuy Citi card at 0% for like 12 months. Perfect payment history with no missed payments.  
My Equifax FICO Score 8 700 since the charge-off was not reporting and only my Citi card was reporting and its also at 28%. Perfect payment history with no missed payments.

My TransUnion FICO Score 8 is 566 has the charge-off reporting and also the city card reporting at 28%. Perfect payment history with no missed payments.

I only have 1 inquiry which was for the credit line increase for my Citi card and then for an SBA loan for coronavirus aid that I got for my small business. The loan is still not reporting but it will be for just $1,000

,CRedit,"I was in a high speed (90-100~ mph impact) car accident back in July 2015 caused by a reckless driver, and because the lawyer I hired waited around until the other driver's insurance company went into bankruptcy/insolvency, I was effectively hit by an uninsured driver and added $14,000 to my three USAA credit cards before I finished physical therapy.

My credit score at the time of the accident was 785, and something like 365 afterwards. When the dust settled, I opened a secured card and paid it faithfully for a couple of years, only to find that I was still hovering at about 400 on Vantage and even less with FICO until very recently. I was pretty disheartened, and when I got strapped for cash earlier this year, just decided to let it default so the secured amount would pay it off. I figured if I was still getting denied for the crappiest secured card offers and even cell phones and utilities after 4.5 years that there was no reason to even try until I have enough income to start with a clean slate. 

These three cards are now at about $21,000 after interest based on my calculations, but I just recently decided to look at Credit Karma for no particular reason and saw that they'd all dropped off the list of collection accounts. As it turns out, Texas has a four year statute of limitations which is 3 years less than I assumed, and this date apparently just passed. 

That said, I have some thinking to do now. Even though the debts can no longer be considered valid, credit reporting agencies will continue to hold them against me until 2023, as will USAA perhaps indefinitely. But my Vantage score is suddenly now 499 again with a FICO of 471, and I've only got about $3500 in debts hanging over my head between medical bills and petty loans that haven't yet expired. So I have options. But if I pay off every single last one of these and zero out the balance on a family member's card that lists me as an authorized user, Credit Karma says I'll only gain 125 points, and 624 is still 'bad credit' especially considering the FICO number is likely lower.

1) So, where do I go from here? Do I have any hope of a credit score that won't get me turned away by landlords and credit cards before 7 years is up? Also, a few side points:

2) Will I never be able to have another product like a credit card or checking account with USAA again unless I pay the full amount with interest? (Company specific, but a bunch of y'all are probably USAA cardholders. I'm afraid to even call them to ask for fear of reviving the legality of the debt.)

3) If I *don't* pay USAA, will the interest never stop accruing on their books? Will they expect $80,000 if I want to make things right with them in 10 years?

4) Should I pay off the others at all or fight to dispute each and every one as defective in some way? I know that full deletes used to restore more points and payoffs sometimes had no net benefit. Paying these off would also pretty much bankrupt me at the moment, but it could still be worth it.

,CRedit,"I was originally pre-approved about a few months back for an FHA loan on my first house. 

Credit score was ""good"" when my loan officer spoke to me about it, at least in the sense it was enough for a loan, probably about 660 at the time. Credit Karma had me a bit higher but I know they aren't accurate. 

However, I'm a clueless first time buyer and when paying my credit card this month online I accidentally clicked on the minimum payment and didnt catch until a days later. Of course now that I realize there is a credit check at closing, I freaked out and paid the whole balance like I intended to do. 

I called my CC company, explained the mistake and hoped they would help since my statement cycle was over and I carried a balance. Of course, they were no help and  now its reported I have a huge balance on a card with a fairly small limit. 

Again, I paid the card off a few days after I noticed the error but I'm closing on the house in a week and my new score won't drop until probably the 28th of the month and according to Credit Karma it caused a huge drop in my score. 

Am I screwed now for closing? 

I honestly have no idea what to do. My current rental is on borrowed time and has been a complete nightmare with a shady landlord, obnoxiously loud tenants etc.

Edit: My credit score from the lenders original pre-approval letter was something like 650-680. Not sure what system they use. I know credit karma is notoriously inaccurate but it did show a substantial drop after my new credit card statement hit with the balance.

Honestly, I'm not sure why my score is so low. I haven't been late on a credit card payment in the year I've had it. I've paid my car loan on time 40 months in a row.

Chase auto loan, open since July 2018- 13k balance 
Capital one credit card with 500 balance, open since November.
Mission lane credit card with 500 balance, open since June.

Verizon in the amount of 1400. This had previously fallen off but a collection agency picked it up and it showed up on my report back in October. ( I tried disputing this and wasn’t successful)

Only showing one hard pull which was the capital one card.

Soon after I received an $800 bill to which I ignored for a while. As of this year, the debt was submitted to collection/charge-off which negatively impacted my credit when looking for loans, etc. It is the only negative mark on my report.

It is for a $50 doctor office visit from January 2019. I called the office and they said I did pay the co-pay but a few weeks after my visit, they sent a bill for a procedure I had done which my insurance did not cover. I moved from that address by that time and never got the 2 letters they sent. I am in my 20s and want to find a way to get this mark off my credit report. Would it be best to pay it with the collection agency or the office themselves? Or should I dispute it?&lt;/p&gt;

I've been doing a great job in paying off collections this year, subsequently improving my credit.

,CRedit,"Howdy! 

I have been lurking on this sub for a long time and really appreciate everyone who contributes here. It has helped shape my thinking financially for the better along with a few other subs over the past 2-3 years

I have been actively working on improving my credit the last 5 months and it’s working, it’s becoming quite fun to see the score rise. 

I’m now moving onto tackling the blemishes on my credit report and one in particular I’m looking for advice with is below. 

It’s an old Wells Fargo “College Credit Card” I received when I was in school and did well with it but once I got into a little bit of a financial tight squeeze, I completely neglected it. Stupid but it is what it is and I’m looking correct it now. 

I just pulled my credit report this morning to start this process and find out what I need to address — here’s what it says under the Wells Fargo Credit Card entry... 

Potentially Negative 

Account Name: WF CRD SVC
Account Type: Credit Card 
Date Opened: 12/31/2008

Status: Account charged off. $500 written off. $500 past due as of July 2020. 

Status Updated: July 14, 2020

Balance: $500
Credit Limit: $700
Highest Balance: $925

On Record Until: Feb 2021


Questions:

1. Does it still look like Wells Fargo is holding the debt? Or was it sold to a collection agency?

2. The status is confusing to me. Can you help decipher that, can it be charged off, written off and still have a past due balance at the same time? 

3. On record until Feb 2021, does that mean it would fall of then? 

4. If Wells Fargo still holds the debt, what are the odds I could pay it off and reopen the account? Is it likely they would do that and would it be beneficial to my credit score more so then letting it fall off or just paying it off? 

5. Would love any info on maybe other angles or general thoughts on my situation I haven’t mentioned.

Paid off Capital One auto loan.

Paid off 3 collections than stopped because I found out that does nothing for my credit scores.

**I have 4 collections:**

1 Verizon Bill from 5 years ago - $2100

3 Medical Bills - All together under $1,000 - thinking of just paying off.

Obviously, I am fully aware I am not ready to buy a house, but I spoke to a lender in order to help guide me into what I needed to do in order to buy a house, this is a goal for myself to teach my 10-year-old son.

I think according to SOL for both California and Texas its only 4 years (We applied for all the credit cards while we lived in Texas and we moved to California in 2016) So im guessing we cant be sued for these amounts anymore?

,CRedit,"Hi everyone! 

I saw a comment awhile back from a post on someone asking how they got their collections account removed from their credit. This commenter pointed out a strategy of waiting until their collections agency sold their account to another agency. The person apparently had the full amount ready to pay but waited until the new agency sent them a letter notifying them of the change. Well, they paid the collections to the new agency within the 30 day grace period. However, the new agency didn't report the collections to the credit bureau because it was paid. The commenters then called the former agency and had their collections removed from their credit. I was wondering if this was possible to do? Are the collection agencies still able to report even if they provided a grace period and the debt was paid? Are the former agency allowed to keep their report in your credit even if they sold it?

,CRedit,"A little backstory, a few years ago, thanks in part to my kid's dad, and of course my own bad decisions, I had a catastrophic credit disaster.  I had still been in rebuild status at that point, and all my hard work had just gone down the tubes, not to mention an eviction in which I still owe $4000, per a judgment in my local county courthouse.  I ended up falling back down to low 500's.

I had seriously considered filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy to rid myself of debt from my car loan and the eviction.  But I was even too broke to afford to file and pay an attorney.  In one way, I was lucky to have student loans that have been reporting as paid as agreed while in deferment status (not yet 6 months out of school).

Fast forward to present day, after giving up my previous car to the bank 3 years ago, I was able to finance another vehicle in February.  I also applied for and was approved for 2 credit cards in January/February, both credit building cards with low limits.  I pay them off every month.  Since then, I've been approved for 2 more cards and a Kohl's store card.  I don't plan on acquiring anymore credit cards.  I have a combined credit limit of $1800.00.  The car payment is on Auto pay, and I've been making student loan payments even though they are in emergency forbearance due to Covid 19.  

Credit Karma shows me at about 640 for both TransUnion and Equifax.  (I know CK isn't 100% accurate and the actual scores could be lower).  Credit Sesame has the same score.  I have credit score monitoring with one of my credit cards, which provides me with my Experian Score, and I'm at 643 (In May, I was at 590, so I've made good progress!).  I'm also signed up with Experian to receive all 3 scores per the FICO 8 model.  Those scores are quite a bit lower, two high 500's and TU is 603.  I'm still trying to learn about the different scoring models.  

I've been able to dispute a few negative items and get those removed, and the other negative items are anywhere between $70 and $900.  I only have 7 total collections between the 3 bureaus.  This is not including the $4000 eviction judgment.

Which brings me to my questions....to get these smaller items paid off, what is the best way to negotiate a settlement offer?  what is a fair offer?  20%, 50%?  

Also, has anyone used Experian Boost and had any significant results?  Is it worth my time?  I've tried to sign up, but it doesn't recognize my bank to link to, so this may not even be relevant.

And finally, is it possible to increase my score by 100 points in a year?  I'm hoping to buy a house using USDA financing next year once my lease is expired in June.  That will put me at 2 years positive rental history since my previous eviction.  Plus my car loan and 2 of the 5 cards will be at 1 year repayment history.   I'm really wanting new construction (single mom, don't want to deal with an older house and lots of repairs), so I'd like to start the approval process a little earlier than June.  According to their underwriting guidelines, they'll accept a low as 620, but I'll have to provide explanations for much of my past credit history.  640 they won't be as picky, and 680 is ideal.

I had still been in rebuild status at that point, and all my hard work had just gone down the tubes, not to mention an eviction in which I still owe $4000, per a judgment in my local county courthouse.  I ended up falling back down to low 500&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had seriously considered filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy to rid myself of debt from my car loan and the eviction.  But I was even too broke to afford to file and pay an attorney.  In one way, I was lucky to have student loans that have been reporting as paid as agreed while in deferment status (not yet 6 months out of school).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to present day, after giving up my previous car to the bank 3 years ago, I was able to finance another vehicle in February.  I also applied for and was approved for 2 credit cards in January/February, both credit building cards with low limits.  I pay them off every month.  Since then, I&amp;#39;ve been approved for 2 more cards and a Kohl&amp;#39;s store card.  I don&amp;#39;t plan on acquiring anymore credit cards.  I have a combined credit limit of $1800.00.  The car payment is on Auto pay, and I&amp;#39;ve been making student loan payments even though they are in emergency forbearance due to Covid 19.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Karma shows me at about 640 for both TransUnion and Equifax.  (I know CK isn&amp;#39;t 100% accurate and the actual scores could be lower).  Credit Sesame has the same score.  I have credit score monitoring with one of my credit cards, which provides me with my Experian Score, and I&amp;#39;m at 643 (In May, I was at 590, so I&amp;#39;ve made good progress!).  I&amp;#39;m also signed up with Experian to receive all 3 scores per the FICO 8 model.  Those scores are quite a bit lower, two high 500&amp;#39;s and TU is 603.  I&amp;#39;m still trying to learn about the different scoring models.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been able to dispute a few negative items and get those removed, and the other negative items are anywhere between $70 and $900.  I only have 7 total collections between the 3 bureaus.  This is not including the $4000 eviction judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

I live in California since 2016 but i started the credit card application in Texas in 2014.

Also, i believe i said something over the phone with a collection agency a few years ago im not sure probably 2017 or 2018 about willing to probably pay a charged off debt in the future. Could that really reset the SOL clock even just by saying something like that over the phone verbally?

And when does the ""7 year clock"" starts for the negative reports to drop off from the credit report?

Finally, even if the negative report gets removed after 7 years, can creditors keep reporting the unpaid debt to the credit bureaus which means they are going to have the negative reports pop up again on the credit report which in turn will start another 7 year of a negative item on the report?

I had a recording of the call but my stupid idiot deleted the call so I can't share it anymore.

They claim that the account was opened under my name at an old address of mine which I owe them nearly 1.3K. The issue is that I never opened an account with Credit One Bank especially with their horrible reputation on top of which they claimed the account was opened in 2015 and then went to collections in 2017.

Back in 2015 I never authorized or gave permission to Credit One Bank to open an account under my name and should of never been possible in the first place as I was only 14/15. I don't recall what happened but I do remember it showing on my credit report where I disputed the accounts as a fraudulent account as it was illegal to have an account open since I wasn't of legal age and was unauthorized account that I never opened with them. As of now it's gone from my report which was last seen around like 2018? Of course now it's being brought up again.

What would you guys advise me to do at this point as it's ridiculously annoying dealing with this as it shouldn't of been opened in the first place as it was unauthorized account that I never opened and an illegal one as I wasn't even the legal age of 18. How do I respond to these crappy bank and the collectors?

Am I overthinking this? I didn’t know they pull court records and for that matter where else are they looking for info? This was a one time typo in a small city court, not even county or state.

1) is my credit score good? I'm 18 and have a score of 680.

2)I checked my credit score for the first time a few days ago, and it's rather higher than I expected - considering I've never used a credit card or loan, so how DO they calculate my score?

3)other than getting a credit card, using it regularly and paying off my credit card bill, how do I up my credit? I have no use for a loan, line of credit or mortgage right now - I don't have enough money to buy a house, I'm getting tuition assistance from government (OSAP), and I'm not planning on buying a car soon. Is credit card the only way to improve my credit right now?

4) I noticed when looking at a chart that my credit suddenly jumped up from 550 to 680 in the past month - how is this? Could it be because I got a job, and if so, does having a job also improve credit?

,CRedit,"Hello Reddit,

Over the last couple of years I had taken out quite a few (good 4 - 5) high interest loans due to having poor credit. At first I took them out to cover finances, then I took some out to consolidate the loans I already had. 

As my situation began to improve, I was able to build up my credit and get approved with a Lending Club loan with a lower rate and consolidate all my personal loans into one. I have since then paid off that loan, including my credit cards, I have no more debt and I've raised my credit scores all above 730.

My issue is that I'm having trouble continuing to build my credit. 
My credit cards have all been approved at low limits. I've had capital one for about 5 years now and the highest limit they've allowed is $3,000. And I just recently got a Discover card a couple months ago with a limit of $1500.

I haven't been able to raise my credit limits or get a new credit card due to:

""Having too many loans taken out in a short period of time."" 

My payment history has been 100% for years now, all my debt has been paid off for quite some time now and I've paid off all my credit cards in full every month. 

I thought that would be a positive note on my credit report. No? And if not, how can I fix this. Is it possible to have those old loans removed from my history?

I have no other issues on my credit report.

Any help information is appreciated.

Thank you!

&lt;p&gt;Is there any debt forgiveness since I am disabled and on SSI? &lt;/p&gt;

I was planning on paying a chunk of it off when I got the first bill.

,CRedit,"Hi friends,

So I just found out that every year between 2013 and 2017 when I went to CVS for my flu vaccine, there would be a $2-$4 copay that I didn't know about. If they ever sent me (or my parents, all of these are from high school/college) a bill for the amount I never got it, or my parents discarded it. I just got a bill from the Minute Clinic that was unrelated and saw years of pending payments associated with my name that were all sent to a collection agency, which I again never got any notification about. In total they amount to about $12, which I was just going to go ahead and pay along with my current bill. 

My question is, is it worth it in any way to contest it being sent to a collection agency? Without giving too many details I was a minor for most of the time period and on my parents' insurance for all of it. It's such a small amount I doubt it could have much effect on my credit score at this point, but just the term ""collection agency"" makes me a little jumpy. I figured I'd ask here just in case.

,CRedit,"Hello everyone! First time poster and first time home buyer applying for a private conventional loan. My lender is unable to pull my credit from Equifax but has no issues with Transunion or Experian. The close of escrow date is 8/17/2020 so we’re getting down to the wire. I’m hoping to find some guidance or hear about anyone’s experience with Equifax specifically. 

This has been the process so far:

7/27: Found out from my loan officer that I need to “unfreeze” my credit with Equifax. Tried multiple times to register online. That day I called and followed the automated prompts multiple times, using multiple addresses, and ultimately found out that I needed to submit a cover letter, drivers license, and social security card via fax or mail to confirm my identity. Fax would take 3-5 days, mail would take 5-7 days. According to the customer service rep, after they received the fax, it would take an additional 5-7 days for me to receive a confirmation in the mail.

7/28: Faxed unfreeze request via UPS including the documents listed above that they required. 

7/31: Called Equifax to inquire if they had received my fax. Per the representative, the only way I could know if Equifax received the fax is if I receive a confirmation in the mail. Was told I could call back the next day.  

8/1: Called Equifax back again. Was told that again, nothing was appearing under my name or SSN. Was told to fax my documents again. 

8/2: Faxed my documents from my work. 

8/4: Called Equifax again. Nothing received on their end. 

8/6: Called Equifax again. Nothing received. Our loan officer’s assistant called saying to that my credit report is listed as a “possible fraud.” Was told to call a different Equifax number. Followed the same automated prompts with three different addresses. No accounts were found.

First time poster and first time home buyer applying for a private conventional loan. My lender is unable to pull my credit from Equifax but has no issues with Transunion or Experian. The close of escrow date is 8/17/2020 so we’re getting down to the wire. I’m hoping to find some guidance or hear about anyone’s experience with Equifax specifically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the process so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/27: Found out from my loan officer that I need to “unfreeze” my credit with Equifax. Tried multiple times to register online. That day I called and followed the automated prompts multiple times, using multiple addresses, and ultimately found out that I needed to submit a cover letter, drivers license, and social security card via fax or mail to confirm my identity. Fax would take 3-5 days, mail would take 5-7 days. According to the customer service rep, after they received the fax, it would take an additional 5-7 days for me to receive a confirmation in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/28: Faxed unfreeze request via UPS including the documents listed above that they required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7/31: Called Equifax to inquire if they had received my fax. Per the representative, the only way I could know if Equifax received the fax is if I receive a confirmation in the mail. Was told I could call back the next day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/1: Called Equifax back again. Was told that again, nothing was appearing under my name or SSN. Was told to fax my documents again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/2: Faxed my documents from my work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/4: Called Equifax again. Nothing received on their end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8/6: Called Equifax again. Nothing received. Our loan officer’s assistant called saying to that my credit report is listed as a “possible fraud.” Was told to call a different Equifax number. Followed the same automated prompts with three different addresses. No accounts were found. THEN I talked to a Equifax representative who said that she could not tell me the name listed, but that my name was not correct according to her files. I have never once changed my name. &lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Hi all

I remember searching high and low for information when this happened to me, so thought I would post my recent woes and results on the above if it helps somebody else.

In November 2019, ahead of COVID, I underwent an unplanned hardship and was unable to pay my Personal Gold Card American Express Charge Card.   I buried my head in the sand and ignored all their letters until March when it was going to go to court to speak to them.   I was (and still am) in a very good job and was regularly using my card between business travel and personal use to the tune of about xx,000 USD a month.  I was a card member in always good standing since 2014.

I dealt with the legal department who was not at all scary (in the end) and who actively worked with me to come up with a hardship plan for payments.  I paid 50pct first (thank you tax refund), and the rest in 4 payments.  I ended up paying a month early than planned for.  For this plan, they offered if I stuck to it that they would reinstate my card and membership reward points.

During the above period, before the debt management plan, my card was reported to credit agencies as Charged Off / Closed in January2020.    Upon the final payment above, I got a near immediate 30 point increase.

In addition, 30 days after the payment AMEX called me and reinstated my card in full.  It is limited to xx,000 spend per month.   I was so happy about this as this basically the same as what I had before the account was charged off.   I honestly expected it to be about 30% of my average monthly spend so getting 100% is a great result.

Now the final part is to see what credit reporting occurs for the new card number - to see if (a) the charge off changes further or remains and a new account appears for reporting, or (b) this replaces that charged off status to open (doubtful I am sure).

Either way with my other credit card balance (I went from 98% utilization to 2%) pay down I have managed since March to get my credit score from 588 to 720 again.   Albeit, I have a fear that the AMEX account above coming back may create a hit initially.....    I'll try to report back in 30 more days once I see what the credit reporting is to share that if helpful.

It was a horrible blip on my credit history and will no doubt cause me issues for the 7 odd years it remains there.   But my hope is as time goes on lenders will see it as less of an issue and the fact I paid and they reopened my account is the best outcome I could have hoped for.",t2_6e6ioihs,False,,0,False,American Express Charge Off / American Express Reinstatement,[],r/CRedit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_i4x21o,False,light,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Collections &amp; Charge Offs,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1596766766.0,text,6,,,text,self.CRedit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all&lt;/p&gt;

I have bad credit (per Experian).  It's a mix of me subscribing to the 1950's housewife model - no working outside the home, my name on nothing at all, and being ""taken care of"" - that, and just not being more proactive in my own finances as an adult.  Live and learn.  

I had small credit cards my ex allowed me to open, and then he would stop paying.  He would subsequently throw out any bills that came.  Banana Republic and VS went to collections, within the past three years.  Dealing with a lot in the last few years (illness, infidelity, divorce), I decided to have selective amnesia and pretend it didn't exist. And here I am. 

My credit score is right now 620.  It was 540 a year ago, and I got it up to 710. 

I do not own a home, my car lease is in my ex's name, and he wouldn't put my name on it, even though I pay for it (and have to pay for it, per the divorce decree).

I am embarrassed to admit I have three accounts in collections.  Two store, one doctor.

I owe $200 to a doctor who gave me B-12 shots, told me ""come in whenever, no charge"" - then charged me for eight ""office visits"" for shots I said I could give myself. He moved away, I have new medical insurance, and he just recently reported it to my Exquifax. I assume that is the dip from 710 to 620. 

I opened a secured credit card last spring and have been paying that off every month.  I just learned I should only be using 1/3 of that full amount, and I've been charging and paying half every month.  So there's that.

In one year I will need to get my own car and my own home. I will have the money for both, but not a reliable history to be lent the credit.

Pay for delete, I am reading, is an urban legend.  I am not sure what to do about the debts. Pay in full? Settle? Ignore? Also, is it worth it to ask someone close to me to add me as an authorized user on a credit card and then, of course, never use the card?

Really, any help would be appreciated.  I have so much of my life in order now and I can't pretend this doesn't exist anymore.

&lt;p&gt;Any experience with this? We are waiting on this to generate in order to get a mortgage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

 I said I am not randomly sending cash for the hopes that what he said would happen.

,CRedit,"Hello,

Like the title says I'm just a college student who has a couple of questions about credit. I'm getting different answers from different people whenever I ask some of these questions so Im not sure how things exactly work.

First question is that I currently have 3 credit cards and I usually use one for a month then I rotate to the others. I pay them off monthly on time and have never missed a payment. The reason why I have multiple cards is because of some of the promotions that come with opening up certain cards. My question is does having more credit cards and paying them off on time improve my credit?

My second question is can I check my credit score without hurting my credit. Some people have told me that it could hurt my credit doing so but I'm not too sure. If I could check my score without hurting my credit where would be the best place to do that ?

My third question is will paying my monthly minimum balance hurt my credit? I have been working and going to college at the same time and so far I've managed to make it into my last 2 semesters without having to take any loans out or anything. Issue is I don't know if I'm going to be able to  afford it now as classes in these last 2 semesters are going to be really expensive. I estimate that by the time I graduate I'll have like 9k that I have to pay back. What would happen if my credit limit is 9k and I use my card to pay that balance, then I end up paying the monthly minimum?

For info:

\-I have 1 credit card through my bank with a credit limit of $5000. I have automatic payments set up and really only use the card for essentials, so the balance/payments are always well under the credit limit.

\-I have a pretty sizable amount of student debt, and am about to take on more for my graduate program (about \~$120K currently. Yes, it sucks). However, I've never missed or been late on a payment. My oldest of the loans were taken out in 2013, and 2 of those accounts have been closed since due to aggressive repayment the last year.

\-I do not have any other loans/debt.

,CRedit,"Hello all!

My wife and I are approaching the 2 year anniversary of our banhkruptcy discharge date. My stomach is currently in KNOTS worrying about whether or not we will be approved for a mortgage after the 2 year waiting period. For any of you that have been through this before you'll know what I mean. 

Our credit scores are currently sitting between 645-655 and we've had no missed payments since bankruptcy. Our debt-to-income ratio is pretty good I feel, after including car payments, active student loan payments (others in deferment), which is all that is really on our reports. It puts us at about 23% DTI without considering our credit card debt which we intend to pay off prior to applying (it's not a lot), which should give our scores a bump too.

Eyeing houses in the Orlando Florida area around 185K, planning on having at least the 3.5% down required, possibly up to $20k depending on some circumstances. But still hoping an approval to come through for at least $185k-200k

My question to everyone who has been through it before, what was your experience like? Was it hard for you to get a mortgage? Was there anything additional that they needed from you? Is there a specific mortgage company that would be more forgiving than others?

,CRedit,"Mods - I've noticed a huge amount of posts from people confused to high heaven why their score has changed, so I thought we might benefit from a sticky. I'm sure someone could come up with something more refined, but I threw this together as a starting point if it proves useful.

# Credit Score vs. Credit Report

First things first: your credit score is a number that is designed to indicate to a potential lender how risky of a borrower you are. *EVERYTHING* that is used to generate your credit score comes from your credit report. The scores are provided as a service to lenders to make it easier for them to determine your risk level, rather than trying to interpret and weigh everything on your report themselves.

Moral of the story: **if your score changed, something on your report changed. Start with your reports.**

# Credit Reports and Credit Bureaus

The 3 major credit bureaus (also sometimes referred to as consumer reporting agencies) are Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, and they each provide their own credit reports. The information on each might be different, because creditors don't always report to all three bureaus.

The FTC mandates you can get a free copy of all 3 of your credit reports (normally once per year, but because of COVID it's once per week through April 2021) from [https://www.annualcreditreport.com/](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). When your score changes, you can compare your most recent report to the previous to see what changed.

Moral of the story: **get your reports every week and save them as PDFs, so when there is a change, you can compare your reports and track it down (and also verify that it's valid!).**

# What to Look for

This isn't a definitive list of everything that would impact your score, but these are the usual suspects. Check for these first.

1. Adds/removals - added or removed accounts, collections, or public records will have an impact on your score. Inquiries will only impact your score, whether added or removed, if they are ""hard inquiries."" ""Soft inquiries"" will not impact your score.
2. Reported balances - did any go up or down? Down generally helps, up generally hurts (that's not written in stone, but applies in most cases, which is why it says generally).
3. Credit limits - did any go up or down? Up generally helps, down generally hurts.
4. Credit utilization - the percentage of your total available credit that you're using affects your scores; that applies to the utilization of individual accounts, as well as your total utilization across all accounts. Down generally helps, up generally hurts. if your total utilization stayed the same, but you moved everything onto one card and jacked it's utilization through the roof, that could bring your score down.
5. Late payments - any new late payments show up? any removed?
6. Account status - any changes here will likely have an impact, e.g., open to closed, on-time to late, pays as agreed to settled, 30 days late to 60 days late, etc.

Moral of the story: **a change to any field on your report can impact your score (except soft inquiries), but if you've found something in the above list, you've probably found the culprit(s).**

# Score Discrepancies

""My Credit Karma score is different than my Experian score!""

""My TransUnion score is 73 points different on Credit Sesame than through Discover!""

There are different models that can be used to calculate your score. Although there are dozens on the market, the most popular are FICO Score 8 and VantageScore 3.0.

Remembering that *EVERYTHING* used to generate your credit score comes from your credit report, you don't just need to know which scoring model was used to calculate your score, you need to know which report was used, e.g., VantageScore 3.0 based on your TransUnion report, or FICO Score 8 based on your Experian report.

If you're getting your score from somewhere and don't know why it differs from another source, check which model they're using, and which report. You can normally find this in the FAQs, but if not, google is your friend. All else fails, ask customer service.

If you have two scores using the same model and the same bureau's report, check when each last updated the information from the bureau--that could be the source of the discrepancy.

Moral of the story: **a credit score is based on the scoring model used and which report it was used on. Different scoring models on the same report can produce different scores, and the same model can produce different scores when run on different reports.**

The problem: basically I tried checking my score on creditkarma, and when i was filling out the little application one of the security questions said: ""Your credit file indicates you may have a home loan, opened in or around May 2016. Who is the credit provider for this account?"", and then it asked for the monthly payments. Well I indicated ""none of these"" and it gave me my scores(yay!). 

However, I am wondering is this just purely a security question just to throw people off, or is it possible someone opened a loan in my name/there's a mix-up in records? there is no way I can have a home loan.

I just pulled my credit report from TransUnion, and the only account showing up is the Discovery. also info about another inquiry from some company in the report shows 0 for other type of inquiries in the last 7 years. I am checking this right?

I am also a bit worried, since other intl student have told me I had an unusually high credit score and credit limit when I first got my credit score back(people with approximately same incomes/allowances from families). I think it's simply because I only have 1 line, and don't really do much. However, I am not sure why my initial credit limit was higher than everyone. but it has got me worried now.

,CRedit,"I want to leave a really important nugget of advice for readers and members of this sub:

**Bankruptcy isn't bad, it isn't the end of the world, and there isn't a reason to feel ashamed because of it**!

Bankruptcy and credit shaming needs to stop. There's no reason for it! If you are up the your eyes in debt, can't make payments, and collections are hassling you, call up a bankruptcy attorney and discuss your options now!

There are many successful people who have had to declare bankruptcy. Love him or hate him, but Donald Trump did so multiple times (people continue to deride him because of this), but at the end of the day he still lives in his penthouse in Manhattan, owns expensive things, and still pisses everyone off. Trump doesn't care that he did so and neither should you!

It's not 1904 where your lender is your neighbor and your word is your honor. Faceless corporations in the 21st century don't care and neither should you. 

If your debt is unmanageable be it either medical, entrepreneurial, or otherwise don't saddle yourself with debt poverty! Be smart and talk to a bankruptcy attorney today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bankruptcy isn&amp;#39;t bad, it isn&amp;#39;t the end of the world, and there isn&amp;#39;t a reason to feel ashamed because of it&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy and credit shaming needs to stop. There&amp;#39;s no reason for it! If you are up the your eyes in debt, can&amp;#39;t make payments, and collections are hassling you, call up a bankruptcy attorney and discuss your options now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many successful people who have had to declare bankruptcy. Love him or hate him, but Donald Trump did so multiple times (people continue to deride him because of this), but at the end of the day he still lives in his penthouse in Manhattan, owns expensive things, and still pisses everyone off. Trump doesn&amp;#39;t care that he did so and neither should you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not 1904 where your lender is your neighbor and your word is your honor. Faceless corporations in the 21st century don&amp;#39;t care and neither should you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your debt is unmanageable be it either medical, entrepreneurial, or otherwise don&amp;#39;t saddle yourself with debt poverty! Be smart and talk to a bankruptcy attorney today. &lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Hi everyone! 

after a long while of saving money and penny pinching, my wife and I finally have enough to clear up a chunk of our debt. Wife’s credit cards have been paid off and paid off phones we were financing. So that frees up a lot of money in monthly bills and interest for us. 

Now onto my credit...  years back, I hit a really rough patch and had to charge my credit cards for everything and everything got sent to collections. Total about $5500 in collections at the moment. All but one account has been in collections for about 3 or more years. My question is, I’ve read a good amount about pay for delete and such, but I’ve also read that if the collections is older than 2-3 years, just wait the 7 years for it to completely fall off. So I’m asking, what’s the best way to rebuild my credit? My credit score is currently at 520 and it’s a bit depressing that I wasn’t able to assist in purchasing a home or car at the moment. So I really want to make a plan and stick to it. We paid off all our other debt minus everything in collections. I do have about $35000 in student loans, and those come out to $360 a month in payments but that has been manageable. 

So what is the best plan/options moving forward? Secured credit cards to build credit? Would my wife adding me as a user on her credit cards help?

,CRedit,"Hello All,

Seeking some feedback/guidance. My lease for my apartment is up in April, about 8 months from now. I have been looking into getting my family into a home for a while now, but wasn't serious about working towards it until now.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the factors I'm working with:

\- Credit Score around 600. (603 Transunion, 606 Equifax per Credit Karma)

\-One collections item on credit report (\~$650, opened 707/2017, not 100% what it's for, considering disputing but concerned about triggering a lawsuit).

\-Student loans (\~$15k) in good standing thanks to federal forbearance, but were delinquent previously. Plan is to try and qualify for reduced payments when the forbearance is lifted, but unsure if this is reported negatively to credit bureaus.

\-No current credit cards.

\-Current savings = $1k, planning on putting majority of whatever comes from next round of stimulus into it. Assuming it's similar to the last one, that we're aiming at adding \~$2400 to savings.

\~Working full-time, salary \~$55k

\-X-factors: I'll likely get \~1,500 - $2k in Q1 of 2010 and expect to get a tax refund of more than $2k next year.

\-One factor I can't quite nail down is the actual home cost, I'm unsure how my credit situation would affect finance rates which would have a play in how much home we can afford. I currently pay \~$1350 in rent and haven't ever been late, so I'm comfortable with something around that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan to raise the score moderately quickly is to do a credit builder loan, dispute/negotiate the one collections item, and stay on top of the student loans. If we can manage not to touch the savings, then we'll have a bit to put towards housing, it wouldn't be 20% but we'd try to go a route that could work with that. A non-listed X-factor is various family members commitment to help with closing costs/down payments, but I know that's not a guarantee so I'm nor factoring.

My question is: is there a way to turn his authorized usage into something that will build him credit? If yes, will that do more harm than good at this point?

,CRedit,"Hey, so I’m 24 and have BMO for an auto loan. According to credit karma I have a 734 score. Anyway, I’ve had bmo for 3 years for my pickup I bought. I can’t login online, don’t have time to sit on the phone and wait for 27 minutes to pay over the phone, and can’t set up autopay over the phone either. (Until yesterday apparently)? So they would call me after about a week past the due date, I would pay for that month, and then I would post date my next payment. I liked this method because I could get 2 payments done in 5 minutes. And then the cycle would come again 2 months after.. repeat. I’ve done this for 3 years now but this month I never got a call.

I did not receive any sort of calls, emails, or anything. Which YES people - I know it is my responsibility!! But I’ve become used to the call a week after the due date, make my 2 payments, viola. 

Talked to bmo, paid my July and August payment today, and have autopay FINALLLLLY set up over the phone and ready for September. They said they didn’t know if it would be marked late. Given i paid it on the 30th day. (Due date is the 4th of every month) It needs to be “posted and funds available today” for it to not be late?

I’m torn with this. It is ultimately my fault and I will never rely on a phone call for a reminder again. I’ve rebuilt my credit after 2 years of idiocy after high school with a credit card. I have had 6 missed payments in my lifetime and haven’t missed one for 4 years.

What will my credit drop to if (and probably will) my missed payment is reported?

,CRedit,"Hi, Two part question on different topics. I have pretty good credit in the 785 range. A few questions...

I have some store cards with zero balances that are accounts 3-5 years old and I don’t use them. Should I leave these open or close the accounts? I think closing them will look like I have less credit and make my score go down. I have other older credit cards that are at least 15 years old and I would not close them. Just the newer store card ones. 

Also, 2nd unrelated question: I carry a balance on some of my regular visa &amp; mastercards (non-store cards) but not heavy credit utilization, less than 1/4 of the card’s maximum balance is utilized. I pay extra on these credit card bills and I’m reducing my overall debt to get all paid off eventually. I called some of these creditors with higher APRs, and they said they cannot lower my interest rate, since it’s the prime rate + my score that calculates my interest rate. BUT I have this older Barclay (formerly Juniper) card with a crazy low APR of like 7% and then other cards like Citibank or Capital One and they will not budge on the APR lowering request. These cards are like 18% APR upwards to 21% APR. I’m definitely paying the cards with higher APR down first, I always pay early or on time, always pay more then my minimum, adding at least $10-$20 on to minimum payment, and have an overall good standing. How can I play this game better and get lowered APRs? Why such disparity of APR between different card issuers?

,CRedit,"Hello. I recently got my very first credit card at the age of 30. Currently my credit score shows as 685 from credit karma, from my car loan I have been paying for the last year and a half. I am just over halfway through the loan, owing about 4.7k out of the 10k I started at. Before that, I had no credit since my previous car loan, which closed in 2013. When I received my welcome kit for the credit card, it showed me as having a score of 724 from experian.

The card is a Capital One Platinum with a $300 limit. My plan is to build credit over the next 18-24 months with the goal of getting a mortgage and owning a house. 

So how much of this credit should I utilize every month?

 I have tried searching but I can't find a definitive answer. I have found a 'rule of thumb' that you should use 30%, but less is better. Im planning on paying my phone bill , about $65, comes up to just over 20%. 

Would it be better to spend a tiny amount of 10 dollars or so, or does it not really matter as long as I do not max it out?

If my goal is building my credit for a mortgage in 1.5 or 2 years, would it make sense to apply for another credit card in about 6 months time? 

My car loan will be closed out by that time and I know average age of accounts is a factor. I would also like to get a card with cash back or some other rewards, but when I applied for one of those back in December I was declined. Maybe after some credit building with this card, I could qualify.

,CRedit,"Sorry if this is long but I'm confused.

A collection agency for an apartment fees was listed in all of my credit reports. Balance was $1200.

They endorsed &amp; deposit the check, but they're still listed in all reports. In May I sent them another request with copies of the deposited check and original request letter. They had 30-45 days to do this. Still no change.

I was told to make a compliant with CFPB, so I did on Aug 1st. That was Saturday.

They didn't acknowledge that they chose to agree to deposit my check. They could have returned my payment to me if they didn't agree (that's happened before).

&lt;p&gt;My current student loan:$5,534 (another $5,500 on the way in the next 2 to 4 weeks).&lt;br/&gt;
My current balance: $5,315 (Wells Fargo checking account).&lt;br/&gt;
My current credit score: (given by Wells Fargo, Experian data) 643.                                               My monthly net income: $1,100-$1,300 (this might change in the next few weeks).                  My current card: No credit card, just added as an AU on my mom’s card last week, and a debit card with Wells Fargo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I open up a secured card with a bank I haven’t used before? I’ve been thinking of getting a Capital One account/card (I’ve heard good things about Discover secured card too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the income-loan or other similar stats matter as much when applying for a secured card as they do for regular credit cards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My parents are willing to (theoretically) chip in $1,000 or more per month; can I include that as my “income”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My income will change in the next few weeks, depending on if I can find a job during school; should I just report the income I’ve been getting over summer or give the bank a rough estimate?&lt;/li&gt;

,CRedit,"I don't understand why my Experian report says that my 6 student loan accounts are closed and those accounts each show 28 charge offs.

,CRedit,"Hello everyone,

I encouraged my boyfriend to get a credit card last year when he was working a full time job to get him started on building his credit. He made a stupid mistake and kept using it and not paying the bill once he stopped working. Eventually Chase closed his checking account and the credit card. About 3 months after the accounts were closed, I found out about what had happened and I helped him pay off what he owed to chase, which was about double his limit due to late fees. His fico credit score is about 550. I was thinking of adding him as an authorized user on one of my low APR/ low limit cards.

Will adding him to a card as an authorized user help him rebuild his credit at all? I know there’s nothing we can do about the closed card on his report, but I’m wondering if him being involved on a card that is used and paid off monthly will help.

,CRedit,"I recently gave birth at the end of April, and thus have received a couple medical bills associated to that. Being a complete sleep-deprived idiot, I totally forgot about two of them. One is for $203 and the other for $38. Also, based on my claim history with Blue Cross there is another $53 charge that I have yet to receive a bill for, nor is that charge on my online portal with the medical provider. 

I paid the $38 and $203 bills today once I realized that I had forgotten about them. What tipped my memory was a final notice from the place that sent the $38 one saying if I didn’t pay in 15 days it would be sent to collections. Below are my questions:

- I paid the $38 with two days to spare. This was based on the statement date, even though I JUST received that bill in the mail. What will happen if they don’t process that payment in time? 
- I never received a reminder bill for the $203 charge, and it was still with the medical provider. I should be good here then, right?
- I have read that medical collections won’t show on report unless 180 days old and unpaid, is this accurate? Would that be 180 days from the medical service, from the medical bill, or from the collection account?
- I did not receive any bills until 6/1 (birth was 4/27)...how are they already talking collections? I thought that was put off until at least 90 days past due? Or is that 90 days past service (which would then be correct, because it’s been 98 days)

I am calling about the missing $53 bill tomorrow when they are open, so hopefully I can resolve that. I apologize for the long post/freak out.

Hi guys so I am 33, full time job, not looking to buy a house, completely happy with where I am in life! At the moment my scores are 741 (Transunion) 749 (Equifax) using credit karma. I’ve never really been big into my credit score or really cared much so I guess I should be thankful they’re this high. I am however very competitive and now that my fiancé has me hooked on my credit score like it’s a game I want to raise it as close to 850 as I can for no other reason then to gloat (as bad as that sounds)! So my questions are....


1.
Are there random things I can do to bump my score up a few points here and there? 

2.
Are there better ways to be checking my score, without hurting it other then Credit Karma?(I am always scared of scams)

3.
Does anyone else kind of look at your credit score like a game or an achievement rather than in the serious nature we probably should look at it?

4.
That Experian Credit Boost has to be a total scam! 🤔 or is it??? I’d really like to know if anyone has tried it!

5.
My Fiancé’s one question she wants to know is why does it take 7 years for late payments to come of your credit? (I’m rocking a perfect payment history and gloat about it)



In advance. I look forward to your responses and I’m very thankful for those who take the time to help me. I’m sorry I hope there truly is no such thing as a stupid question! And I’m not trying to offend anyone!

,CRedit,"Okay, I know this sounds like an absolutely ridiculous question (and it very possibly is), but please hear me out first.

I'm an 18 (almost 19) year old sophomore in college. I have 3 credit cards so far (I got the first one in December) and have diligently used then paid them off, which is hopefully somewhat evident by my Fico scores:

712, 723, 720 (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, respectively).

According to the Experian app, the only 2 things keeping my credit scores down are:

1. Short account history
2. No loan activity/no diversity in credit

Okay, there's no way to fix short account history other than continuing to use and pay off my cards. However, I can maybe fix the lack of loan activity. I'm on full scholarship for four years, so I don't have student loans and really don't plan on having any for the rest of my undergrad. But I'm thinking I can apply for an unnecessary personal loan. My plan for this loan would be to immediately pay back half of it, divide the remaining balance by 12, and pay that amount monthly, while never actually using the loan money for anything. If I don't get this personal loan, I really wouldn't have any loan activity until I finance a car or house, but that's quite a while from now. 

I've been thinking about this lately and haven't been able to come to a solid conclusion. Any and all advice on this is welcome.

,CRedit,"Hi everybody,

Sorry for the long post, but wanted to make sure I explained the issue comprehensively. In a nutshell, after a credit disaster in 2017, I rapidly get back on track and by late 2018 my scores are great. By January 2020, my scores have tanked and I haven't been able to really improve them. Thanks for the help!

Back in the Summer of 2017, I had a minor credit meltdown. I let the balance on a BofA card get up to $9,200 and didn't pay anything for more than 60 days. I also didn't pay a much smaller $500 balance on an Amex card and just ignored it for several months. Yes, I'm an idiot. I also had student loans and a mortgage at the time that I didn't miss any payments on.

BofA deactivated my card but I methodically paid off the balance over the next year so by Summer of 2018 the entire balance was paid off. Unfortunately BofA wouldn't reactivate the card because they said that specific card had been suspended. This was a blow because it was my oldest account (over 15 years). AmEx sent me a letter saying that they would issue me a crappy Optima credit card if I paid off what was now a $700-ish balance with them. I knew my credit score was likely garbage so I took them up on this offer. 

Despite these CC issues, I had student loans that I never missed a payment on and paid off completely at the beginning of this year. I also have had a mortgage for 4.5 years I never missed a payment on.

By the Fall of 2018, to my surprise my credit score had significantly increased to the point it was decent - low 700s. I took out a new credit card and managed it responsibly and my credit score went up. In 2019, I got a little ahead of myself and opened three new credit cards. I have managed them responsibly and paid on time every month. These dinged my scores when I opened them up but not by too much.

More recently, in the Fall of 2019 a collection showed up on my account. It's from an old issue for only $125, but unfortunately just appeared on my reports. I also had to take out a personal loan in January for $4,000 to replace my heating system.

These two things have seemed to tank my scores and they have only increased a tiny amount over the past 7 months. CreditKarma says I'm fine (low-to-mid 700s) but my Credit Cards have free FICO scores and those are much worse (ranging from 662 to 695). Since the whole 2017 issue, I have paid every account on time, and my amount of credit used compared to what's available is very low - always less than 5 percent. So I'm trying to figure out what's killing my score.

All of the sites say I have too many recent inquiries and subpar average credit age. I know the collection is not helpful, but it doesn't explain the 70 point drop and barely any improvement. 

I have paid off the $4000 personal loan taken out in January to the point there's only a few hundred bucks left on it. I'm thinking of calling my bank to see if they'll increase my loan amount, just so I can keep the account open, because I think closing an account that's only been open 7 months will tank my score. Also I still have my crappy Amex card with a $500 limit and $50 annual fee. I would like to cancel it to avoid the stupid fee but am also scared closing the account after 2 years will hurt me. Do you guys think that would help? Is there something else I'm missing?

The only other thing that might be hurting me is that although I pay my credit card balances fully every month, sometimes they show a small balance on the statement because a pending charge will materialize or I buy something between the account due date and statement date.

,CRedit,"At the start of the new year, I decided I'd had enough of my awful credit and decided to really commit to making positive changes so that my husband and I could get a mortgage at a decent rate in a year or two. I made a lot of stupid decisions that ultimately brought my FICO/Vantage scores to an all time low of around 450. I couldn't qualify for anything - it was super embarrassing being asked by cashiers to try and qualify for a store card and knowing my credit was so shitty it wasn't worth it. I swore I would have awful credit for the rest of my life (I'm 29). 

I started browsing this subreddit and the myFICO forums for advice on how to start repairing my credit. I started by paying off $500 worth of old collections I'd let sit around on my report for 5 years and my score jumped up to 620. I paid off my credit card balances I'd been shoveling minimum payments and over the next four months, my score gradually climbed and it's currently sitting at a 701. My next major hurdle was the late payments on my report - I consolidated my student loans and 10 late payments turned my payment history from 98% to 80%.

I made some bad choices with my auto loan about 3 years ago and my mistakes were haunting me. I asked around and everyone told me I had no chance in hell and that this specific lender never changes factual information, but I tried anyways. I wrote a goodwill letter explaining why I missed payments, what I learned from it and used my positive payment history since to ask for mercy. I addressed it to the VP of Customer Service and sent it via email.

Today I received a call from his assistant letting me know that they would be removing ALL of my late payments (10!) and sending me a letter for confirmation.

I made a lot of stupid decisions that ultimately brought my FICO/Vantage scores to an all time low of around 450. I couldn&amp;#39;t qualify for anything - it was super embarrassing being asked by cashiers to try and qualify for a store card and knowing my credit was so shitty it wasn&amp;#39;t worth it.

I do have plenty of money in my bank account (enough to easily cover my Amex credit limit). I've been holding off on paying down my other outstanding debts because I'm on UI and you know, the situation is uncertain.

It just so happens the PUA payments end this week.

They also know I have additional household income from family. They asked me about all that. They already knew but asked anyway. 

Here's the thing. I have previously, for years, up until I got this job last year (and paid it all off at once), carried my Amex at its max credit limit, always paying just above minimum payments, never missing a payment.

Well, apparently not anymore. You can probably guess why they've changed their strategy. They're looking to flag anyone who might not be able to pay their debts due to the current pandemic caused environment and whose unemployment money is about to run out.

In any case, they waited to confirm the decision until I had to show them my bank statements and they could verify I was on UI.

I already knew the amount by calling in, so I mailed a check the same day to the address the company provided. This was the only payment option for lease end fees, as the balance on the company payment portal reported $0, because the lease itself was already paid in full. Here's where the fun begins:

About 2 months later, I got a credit alert with a 30-day late. I called the company, turns out they never received check #1. They confirmed the address, but suggested a different one would be better, so I immediately mailed check #2 to the new address. I waited 10 days and called back, they don't have check #2 due to some payment processing delays or backlog, and gave me yet another address. I mailed check #3 overnight and put a stop payment on checks #1 and #2. They received #3 and processed the payment, but by this time they reported a 60 day late on my credit. By the way, I got an email notification 45 days later that their system tried and failed to process check #2 (due to the stop payment), even though by this time they had already processed #3.

After spending countless hours on the phone over several months bouncing between useless reps and supervisors, having to mail 2 letters to their credit dispute team explaining the situation, their final verdict is that the payment was indeed late, and my report was updated with the remarks ""dispute resolved, customer disagrees"".

I'm hesitant to dispute this directly with the CRAs because, in my experience, their lazy solution is to delete the entire tradeline rather than spend time correcting inconsistencies. I don't want to wipe out 36 months of good payment history. My questions:

Should I file a CFPB complaint or find a FCRA/FDCPA attorney? One of my cards was closed with the bank citing the credit score drop as the reason. I see 3 recent soft pulls from my other card issuers with ""Account Review Inquiry"" as the description. I'm afraid this could cause a cascade effect if this drops my score even further.

Is it even legal to report fees as part of the auto lease? The lease itself is an installment agreement with equal monthly payments, while the fee is an unexpected, variable, one-time amount that can be many times higher. Here's an example of how Experian shows this scenario:

,CRedit,"Hi folks,

I am currently transitioning all of my finances away from the credit union (CU) in my old hometown into an online provider, as it no longer makes sense to use the CU from a logistical standpoint. I currently have a checking, savings, and basic credit card (visa) account with that CU. That card has been open since 2013 and is my oldest, active line of credit.

While I haven't used the CU credit card in years since I've gotten other cards, my question is: **will it significantly impact my credit to close the account?**

For reference, my lines of credit/debt are:

* CU credit card (Since 2013)

* Chase Sapphire Preferred (Since 2016)

* Chase Freedom Unlimited (Since 2020, my new daily driver for non-travel payments)

* Student loans (Paid in full as of mid-2019, payments started ~2010)

* No other loans/debt

I currently have a checking, savings, and basic credit card (visa) account with that CU. That card has been open since 2013 and is my oldest, active line of credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I haven&amp;#39;t used the CU credit card in years since I&amp;#39;ve gotten other cards, my question is: &lt;strong&gt;will it significantly impact my credit to close the account?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, my lines of credit/debt are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CU credit card (Since 2013)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Sapphire Preferred (Since 2016)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Freedom Unlimited (Since 2020, my new daily driver for non-travel payments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student loans (Paid in full as of mid-2019, payments started ~2010)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other loans/debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per Credit Karma, my score is ~775 (took a slight hit when I opened the second Chase card last month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on this, is there any reason not to close my old CU credit card? Will closing that line significantly impact my score?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit," 

I strive to have good credit, however I do have a few marks on my reports that are holding me back.

I  have 2 items in collections (medical bill I believe from when I moved  and an old electric bill I didn’t have the money for after I moved to my  new apartment). I have the money to pay both of them in full but I know  some people have said that once they are in collections, you can  negotiate for a cheaper price. Would that be the case still if I ask if  they will do a pay-for-delete on it? The amount for both in full would  be about $550. I would prefer to pay less if possible and have them  deleted but if I would have better luck getting them deleted by paying  in full, which is fine as well. For electric, it is a total of $290 and  is now with L.J. ROSS &amp; ASSOCIATES and says it was assigned to them  on March 31st, 2020. For the medical bill, it is a total of $261 and is  now with Fidelity Collections, which is right down the road from me  actually. It says it was assigned to them on 10/10/2019. I was on the  phone when I canceled my service with the internet company and I was  never informed that I had to return the equipment back to them (I should  have assumed though) and that I still had an outstanding balance (I  thought I was all up-to-date).

My  other mark on my report is I have two 30-day late payments as well. One  from my auto loan company, Santander, and the other one from my credit  card company, Chase bank on my Chase Freedom card. For Chase, I also  only have one mark as a late payment, December 2019. It was due to me  having to put my dog down and moving and having to pay for a U-Haul and  for the vet cost and cremation. I should be able to find my dog’s death  certificate/certification of cremation, and possibly a receipt from  U-Haul. After those non-regular bills, I did not have enough money to  pay my January payment. I have not missed another payment and always  been on time after that. I do have enough money to pay this off in full  ($4,000), not sure if that will make a difference to Chase or not. I  have a second Chase card and that one I have always been on time and  never missed a payment either. For Santander, I only have one mark for a  late payment and it was my fault. It was also in December 2019 as well  and was due to the same reasons as for Chase bank.

TL;  DR - I am looking for help on how to better my report and remove these  derogatory marks from my account.

I missed several payments on my first two credit cards, resulting in one of them being sent to collections back in November of 2019. I received a phone call from the collection agency the day it got turned over and paid it off right then (less than $2,000). Thereafter, I paid off my second credit card (the account is still open today). In the last 8 months I have opened two new accounts, both have just increased my limit to a mere $500 on each line.

I also was able to finance a new car, I had to put a heavy down payment since my credit score was pretty low at the time. In an attempt to repair my credit last July I took out a credit building loan from MoneyLion, which was fine until March of this year. I had automatic payments running on it.

Is there anything I can do to remedy this? I've already got the general ledger and a letter of recommendation from the property manager, but are there additional steps I can take to fix this on my credit?

,CRedit,"Hello 👋 So I have one collection account hurting my credit. I signed up for Collection Shield 360 to hopefully get it removed. The agency sent me the paperwork about 3 weeks ago validating the debt which I then uploaded to CS360. About a week after the validation I got a letter from them stating I owe this amount and have 30 days to contact them to dispute it. 

Well I just revived an email from CS360 that the account has been removed which I found strange since they just validated the debt plus sent me a letter with the amount I owe. I double checked other sites I use and sure enough, it was deleted. 

However, my question is- is the account temporarily deleted because they’re waiting the 30 days for me to dispute the account? And if that’s the case, should I pay? I have the money to pay and don’t mind paying it if it stays gone. I don’t want to pay it and then they’re able to put it right back on my report. I know a PIF collection is better than an unpaid collection but I’d rather continue to try to pay for a deletion if possible. 

The letter they sent me doesn’t say anything about having 30 days to pay to avoid it being placed on my credit report which is why I’m concerned that if I do pay it, they’d be able to report it again.

I signed up for Collection Shield 360 to hopefully get it removed. The agency sent me the paperwork about 3 weeks ago validating the debt which I then uploaded to CS360. About a week after the validation I got a letter from them stating I owe this amount and have 30 days to contact them to dispute it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I just revived an email from CS360 that the account has been removed which I found strange since they just validated the debt plus sent me a letter with the amount I owe. I double checked other sites I use and sure enough, it was deleted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my question is- is the account temporarily deleted because they’re waiting the 30 days for me to dispute the account? And if that’s the case, should I pay? I have the money to pay and don’t mind paying it if it stays gone. I don’t want to pay it and then they’re able to put it right back on my report. I know a PIF collection is better than an unpaid collection but I’d rather continue to try to pay for a deletion if possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter they sent me doesn’t say anything about having 30 days to pay to avoid it being placed on my credit report which is why I’m concerned that if I do pay it, they’d be able to report it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help!&lt;/p&gt;

(I've been on my own since I was 16.) As I tried to clawed my way out  I literally gave up on credit because I had collection letters piled up and unopened. Fast forward, I'm now 40. I managed to work my way into a decent middle class job. However, I had been REALLY afraid of  dealing with my credit life. I have exclusively used a debit card for the past 15 years.

Anyway,  during covid19, Ive had more time to just think because I have one big goal - a home purchase. I've been watching youtube videos and this channel. I have done a few things so far -

1. 5 months ago - Opened up an account and my first secured visa cc with NFCU. 100% on time payments for 5 months and credit karma is showing me with a vantage score of 702 and 708 as of today which is based on this one account

2. This month - I opened up a  Self credit building loan which will begin taking money $48 next month for a 12 month period. (It cost me $9 upfront with some fees along the way but ill get most of my money back). No hard pull for this.

3. This month - took out a small secured loan from my Golden1 credit union  against a CD. I've set this to autopay monthly from my checking on the same day as the other loan. Hard pull on my account.

4. This month - Discover Secured. Applied for and provided $1000 for the card which will be here next week. Hard pull on my account.

5. This month -  Went to the credit union listed in #3 and set up $500 with their secured product, a Mastercard. No hard pull because they used the same one for my secured loan.


In total, this will be 3 revolving cards and 2 installments. I'm very serious about building and adding mix. The loan officer at the credit union told me I am trying to do too much in too short a timeframe and should have waited for 6 months. 

I know I've done a lot this month, but I tried to do some logical planning. I've added 4 items, but I've only taken 2 hard pulls.  Self doesnt  do a hard pull. With one of my credit unions, i was able to consolidate two products with one hard pull because it was in a 3 month period. I also picked secured cards with no annual fee so I can be comfortable keeping them and my credit age forever even if they wont be primary down the line.

 I wanted to pack these all together so I dont reduce the age of my credit by adding some of these piece meal 6 months from now.  I have NO plan or desire to add anything else over the next year. I'm going to maintain and pay all the cards to 10% utilization both loans are autopay. 

Does my plan  make sense? or is there some reason it is bad I added too many  new accounts at the same time.

,CRedit,"Firstly thank you all for helping me through this process. 

I'm currently in the process of buying a home using my VA loan. I have little education on credit / credit use but I've been doing countless research since I began mortgage shopping. I could have sworn up and down that I had good credit but I didn't know about the '30%' credit utilization. Long story short I paid down my debt from owing 60% to 18%.

After reviewing my credit report (one that I received from a potential lender one mortgage shopping)  I noticed a few items in bold.

Best Buy/CBNA - Closed - amount owed $625 - 1 late remark 2015 - this account is current I make all monthly payments I can also pay this off. 

Verizon - Collection - amount owed $529 - this was for equipment that we already returned we have the receipt and everything and were told it was going to be taken out of collection, obviously it didn't. 

Dept of VA - Collection - Amount owed $125 - this was an over payment that I honestly don't even remember ever getting. I just got off the phone with the VA and they have an old address on file which explains why I haven't seen this. Apparently the debt is with the Treasury department now not the VA.


Comenity/Boscovs (department store) - amount owed $0 - 4 late payment remarks. 3 of them are 5/2016, 8/2016, and 5/2017 30-59 days late and 1 of them 9/2016 is for 60-89 days late. This account has been paid off and not used in over 2 years. 

Conserve (a collection agency used by my University) - Amount owed $0 status reads 'Paid Collection' 

My credit score should be at a 640 (fico) with my debt paid down from 60% to 18%, but I want to be at a higher score so I can get better rates. A different lender mentioned a credit repair agency, but everyone on the subreddit seems to hates these agencies. I have the money to pay the debt on the Best buy and VA loan but my lender told me not to do so just yet because it might reflect negatively on my credit. Would it be the same if I write pay for deletion letters? Given my time crunch it'll probably be faster if I pay an agency or someone to do it for me are there any recommendations? Is this something I can realistically do myself? I'm really anxious and would rather get approved with better interest rates than just get approved if that makes any sense.


I'm definitely learning my lesson the hard way

**Update #1** 

Thank you all for your help and advice with this. 

I started doing this on my own and here's how far I've gotten. 

Best Buy - agreed to remove the late payments. They said it'll take about a month to reflect. About 45 min on the phone- Will update in 30 days

Verizon - LITERALLY THE WORST TO DEAL WITH !  But ! They admitted and noticed they messed up and will be removing this off my credit. About 2-3 hours of being transferred between the same two departments. - Will update in 30 days 

Conserve - I gave conserve a call and they stated that they don't remove collections from credit reports. The lady was really rude so I decided to just call my college. I guess everybody's having issues with billing just to get in contact with an agent it took two and a half hours He then placed me on hold for 45 minutes to give me someone else's phone number and email address. I sent the person an email and they actually responded I just responded before updating this post  hopefully they respond by tomorrow and I will update then. 

Comenity/Boscovs - The agent who I spoke to was willing to take off the remarks but when he went into my account he noticed that they were from before 2018 and said he doesn't have access to remove these. He did say to send a Goodwill letter to them and they will remove it. This is what the representative told me. I'm going to try and give them a call tomorrow and see if I get the same information from someone else before writing a letter or to see if I get someone like I did with Best buy who's willing to take it off for me. - will update tomorrow

VA - haven't tried to call them yet. I'm going to try the whole paid to delete thing. Being that the treasury department has this collection I don't think I will get very far, but I will keep you all posted.",t2_12zql4,False,,0,False,Do I listen to my lender or fix it myself need advice,[],r/CRedit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_hz0mxf,False,light,0.9,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mortgage,False,7,,False,,1595991965.0,,[],{},,True,,1595911998.0,text,6,,,text,self.CRedit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly thank you all for helping me through this process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently in the process of buying a home using my VA loan. I have little education on credit / credit use but I&amp;#39;ve been doing countless research since I began mortgage shopping. I could have sworn up and down that I had good credit but I didn&amp;#39;t know about the &amp;#39;30%&amp;#39; credit utilization. Long story short I paid down my debt from owing 60% to 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reviewing my credit report (one that I received from a potential lender one mortgage shopping)  I noticed a few items in bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Buy/CBNA - Closed - amount owed $625 - 1 late remark 2015 - this account is current I make all monthly payments I can also pay this off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon - Collection - amount owed $529 - this was for equipment that we already returned we have the receipt and everything and were told it was going to be taken out of collection, obviously it didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dept of VA - Collection - Amount owed $125 - this was an over payment that I honestly don&amp;#39;t even remember ever getting. I just got off the phone with the VA and they have an old address on file which explains why I haven&amp;#39;t seen this. Apparently the debt is with the Treasury department now not the VA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comenity/Boscovs (department store) - amount owed $0 - 4 late payment remarks. 3 of them are 5/2016, 8/2016, and 5/2017 30-59 days late and 1 of them 9/2016 is for 60-89 days late. This account has been paid off and not used in over 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conserve (a collection agency used by my University) - Amount owed $0 status reads &amp;#39;Paid Collection&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My credit score should be at a 640 (fico) with my debt paid down from 60% to 18%, but I want to be at a higher score so I can get better rates. A different lender mentioned a credit repair agency, but everyone on the subreddit seems to hates these agencies. I have the money to pay the debt on the Best buy and VA loan but my lender told me not to do so just yet because it might reflect negatively on my credit. Would it be the same if I write pay for deletion letters? Given my time crunch it&amp;#39;ll probably be faster if I pay an agency or someone to do it for me are there any recommendations? Is this something I can realistically do myself? I&amp;#39;m really anxious and would rather get approved with better interest rates than just get approved if that makes any sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m definitely learning my lesson the hard way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

So I messed up. I applied and was approved for a Capital One Platinum card. However, I think I applied too soon. My Discover card just graduated last week after 7 months with a $2k credit limit increase. However, that isn't reflected on my credit report. It's still showing as a $200 secured card. Therefore Cap One only approved me for a $300 limit. My Fico 8 TU score is 738 and my Experian is 702. I have no derogatories on my report, the only thing there is just the Discover card and I wanted a second card to boost my score since my credit history is limited. Should I just wait six months and ask for a CLI or should I wait until my credit report reflects the new Discover graduation and call and ask for a CLI increase? I wanna make the hard pull worth it and not have another card that I'm maxing out and paying down once a week.

,CRedit,"Just got the alert that a collection agency has reported $157.00 on two of the credit bureau . My wife ""may"" had gone to perform ultrasound during the pregnancy last year. Now, seems like they have reported the remaining balance. I have few questions as below.

It was for my wife's ultrasound, but they have reported for both of us. My wife, and myself (spouse). Can they do this? I never consented or signed any documents when we have gone for ultrasound. The only thing is I am the prime member of the health insurance.

We went to the one of the biggest hospital in the New Jersey. The hospital has billed us also for the same day, but may be for different codes (may be for providing facility), and the charges which has been reported are for the doctor. When we went to do ultrasound, we thought it will be treated by the hospital but this charges are for a private group who may be providing services inside the hospital. Do we have any legit reason to dispute this claims?

Also, the doctor may have billed as an Out-Of-Network, however, when we went to the hospital, they told us you are in-network and we will bill you as in-network.

As the amount is not a huge, I am OK to pay $157.00 to settle this. However, I would like to know, if anyway I can push the collection agency to completely delete this entries from the credit bureau as I have read that it is vary rare that the collection agency will agree for ""Pay For Delete"".

Edit: I would like to add that the collection date has been written as 03/26/2020. However, the dates of treatments of ultrasounds are from 05/2019 and 08/2020. Can I also dispute this charges with credit bureau on the basis of wrong date?

Edit 2: I just spoke with the collection agency, and the representative told me that once you pay it, it will be deleted from the credit bureau and after 7 to 10 business days, it will not show on the report. But she refused to give me in writing this. She said, we are on the recorded line and I am repeating that it will not show as paid and it will disappear from the credit bureau but I cannot give it in writing. Does it really work this way?

,CRedit,"Hello everyone, 

I've been in the US for a little over a year now. I've never gone a month without paying my card in full. By the time I was issued a score it was 756 (FICO) so I applied for a new card in June and my score dipped to 738, and in a second beaureau it was 712. I got my new card, splitting purchases between the two, then today my score dipped another 16 points for some reason, while the other bureau dipped by 3 points. I hadn't applied to anything, my two statements are $0, so I'm not sure what happened. 
I will list down a few things that changed during that time:

1-I moved to a new place, hated the commute, and moved to another place all within a month. 

2- I made a $550 purchase on one card, paid it off immediately (my credit limit is $2700). I had made similar purchases before when I only had 1k limit, and they never hurt my credit score. 

3- I took the bus to and from work, buying tickets with my card.

I have 2 items in collections (medical bill I believe from when I moved and an old electric bill I didn’t have the money for after I moved to my new apartment). I have the money to pay both of them in full but I know some people have said that once they are in collections, you can negotiate for a cheaper price. Would that be the case still if I ask if they will do a pay-for-delete on it? The amount for both in full would be about $550. I would prefer to pay less if possible and have them deleted but if I would have better luck getting them deleted by paying in full, which is fine as well. For electric, it is a total of $290 and is now with L.J. ROSS &amp; ASSOCIATES and says it was assigned to them on March 31st, 2020. For the medical bill, it is a total of $261 and is now with Fidelity Collections, which is right down the road from me actually. It says it was assigned to them on 10/10/2019. I was on the phone when I canceled my service with the internet company and I was never informed that I had to return the equipment back to them (I should have assumed though) and that I still had an outstanding balance (I thought I was all up-to-date). 

My other mark on my report is I have two 30-day late payments as well. One from my auto loan company, Santander, and the other one from my credit card company, Chase bank on my Chase Freedom card.
For Chase, I also only have one mark as a late payment, December 2019. It was due to me having to put my dog down and moving and having to pay for a U-Haul and for the vet cost and cremation. I should be able to find my dog’s death certificate/certification of cremation, and possibly a receipt from U-Haul. After those non-regular bills, I did not have enough money to pay my January payment. I have not missed another payment and always been on time after that. I do have enough money to pay this off in full ($4,000), not sure if that will make a difference to Chase or not. I have a second Chase card and that one I have always been on time and never missed a payment either. 
For Santander, I only have one mark for a late payment and it was my fault. It was also in December 2019 as well and was due to the same reasons as for Chase bank.

,CRedit,"Hello,

I have had a Discover Secured Card for a year and a half. I had a few months where I had late/returned payments, so I understood that I would not graduate immediately. I was told by Discover to pay the entire statement so that I would have a 0 balance by cycle date. Did that, noticed my FICO scores were not moving. Called again a few months later, was then told to have a small amount that shows you are using the credit available, but can pay it off by due date/cycle date. I have kept statement balances at 10% across my cards for months, but still no graduation.

I'm then told this weekend by Discover that I can't spend more than 30% of what's on the card (even though they were limited on what they could actually tell me besides the general ""Pay your bills on time and keep balances &lt;30%""). So, even though I have a $500 limit, I can only spend $150 in a given month on that card. I use my cards to pay for bills and I make two payments on my cards monthly (one before the due date, and one before the cycle date) to make sure the CRA's show a low utilization and balance.

Does anyone that has had a graduated Discover card have any advice? I have had late payments (unaware that paying by cycle date still counts as late because it's three days after due date), but never missed, so no 30's/60's on my cards. Last ""late"" payment was April '20.

Update: Talked to Discover twice today, with different reps. One said I could not use more than $150 on the card PERIOD per month, the other said you can use as much of the balance as you want, as long as the statement balance is &lt;30%.

I want to use my VA loan for a house next year and have been cleaning up my credit. I had some questions about closed credit cards.

,CRedit,"So I recently opened up a dispute for a product I ordered back in February and never received. I know it's super late to dispute it but it was pretty well damn impossible to reach Chase to dispute it due to tremendous phone wait times because of Covid. 

The week after I did so my credit scores dropped about 20 points across all 3 from around ~750 to ~730 (I use Credit Karma for the TransUnion and Equifax, and Amex for Equifax). 

I checked the full credit report on the TransUnion and it says there's a remark on my Chase account. The remark says the following ""Account information disputed by consumer, meets FCRA requirements""

Besides that nothing else has changed except one of my other cards had a statement balance of like $40 more than last time but my total utilization is still under 10% so it can't be that. 

Am I crazy or did my credit really just drop because I opened up a dispute? Will it jump back up after the dispute closes? Out of curiosity, will it matter if I win or lose the dispute? Can losing the dispute for some reason hurt my credit score further? 

This is the first time I ever dispute something on this card after 2 years of owning it and find it ridiculous that this could affect me negatively.

Thank you in advance for any help.

It is the student discover credit card with the 5% cash back and 5% cash back extra during certain months for certain things like this month you get extra if you use it at restaurants and use PayPal. Also I don’t have to pay interest for the first 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have a $1000 limit and I’m not going to use all that money because that would be dumb of me. I plan on using at most maybe $100 because I’m scared. I know what it’s like to not have money being from a somewhat poor family as in we are barely middle class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with the credit card how can I build my credit even more. I’m open to all suggestions since with the career path I’m choosing I know in about four years I’ll have to take our loans (law school). I would like to build up as much credit that I can in about four years. Since my finical aid is paying for my 4-year degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestion is welcomed. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Hello,

I've lurked on CRedit for a long time and have been really grateful for the advice here, but am using a burner account for this post.

I immigrated to this country three years ago for grad school and since then have been steadily building my credit (thanks in part to this sub!). I now have three student loans, four credit cards (including a Chase Sapphire Reserve) and a charge card (AmEx Gold). I had been making on-time payments for all my cards; my student loans are currently in deferral since I just graduated. By this spring, my credit score had reached 756.

I just checked my Creditwise account and it seems that in June, my credit score dropped 50+ points in one move: to \~695. I didn't miss any payments or initiate any hard inquiries. The only thing I can think of is that, in May, one of oldest credit cards had emailed me to inform me that they were decreasing my credit limit (from $2500 to $300) due to ""lack of use."" This is a Deserve credit card (aimed at international students with no SSN) that I had used to build up my credit earlier. But since the card had barely any credit card benefits, I moved my spending to other cards such as the Amex Gold or the Sapphire Reserve.

I now realize that I should have put some recurring expense on my Deserve card anyway (like a monthly subscription). I regret not doing that.

What can I do from here? Does a decrease in credit limit cause such a *drastic* decrease in credit score? (50+ points!) Could I apologetically ask Deserve for restoring my earlier credit limit?

Separately, my current credit score is 699: how bad is it compared to 750+?

Edit : I use credit karma so I suppose this is my vantage score ?
So I recently just paid off about $400 in collections and now my credit score jumped to 669 Trans and 685 Equifax. This is huge for me because my credit score was in the 400’s at the start of this year. (35 derogatory marks on my auto loan)


Now I’m just trying to figure out how to build it more.
My credit consist of about 9000 in a terrible auto loan that I got when I had no credit score, and 3500 student debt which I don’t start paying on for another 2 years or so when I graduate at $50 a month.

So I recently just paid off about $400 in collections and now my credit score jumped to 669 Trans and 685 Equifax. This is huge for me because my credit score was in the 400’s at the start of this year. (35 derogatory marks on my auto loan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m just trying to figure out how to build it more.
My credit consist of about 9000 in a terrible auto loan that I got when I had no credit score, and 3500 student debt which I don’t start paying on for another 2 years or so when I graduate at $50 a month.

,CRedit," So, here's the story. On January 18, 2019 my wife and I received our discharge on a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Up until the time of bankruptcy, we had never missed a single payment on anything but suddenly learned that we were facing down \~$200,000 worth of repair costs to a storm water drain system that was effecting the structural integrity of our home that we owed \~$140,000 on and was only valued at about $165,000. We looked at all the options and decided that bankruptcy was our best option, so away we went.

  
Fast forward to now, we are working to rebuild our credit so that we can purchase the house we live in now, which my wife's parents purchased and we are paying the mortgage note on. We have a credit card that somehow survived the bankruptcy that has a $5,000 limit and I have gotten one other card with $1,000 limit. Both have rewards points/cash back, and we run all of our purchases through them and pay the entire balance off several times a month. My wife's vehicle is paid off, and I have an auto loan on my car that I have kept with a mind toward showing good payment habits. The interest rate is pretty high considering the loan was gotten after the bankruptcy, but I paid a significant amount of the value in a down payment and financed a low amount of the vehicle's value with the loan, \~$6,000, just to have a payment to make.

My wife's credit score, according to credit karma, is currently in the very low 700's and mine is sitting just under 700 where it has been shifting up and down a point or two at a time depending on when the two credit card companies report the open balances. I've had a couple of months where my balances were paid off completely at just the right time and my credit utilization was at \~2-3%, and other times that it was at \~15-25%, but we haven't paid a cent in CC interest since our ""fresh start"".

So I say all of that to ask this; I don't know what the right thing is to do next to continue to build my credit score. We need to get our home into our name because we are missing out on the homestead tax exemption and also paying a higher interest rate than most mortgage loans because this is technically a second home for my in-laws. I'm considered a ""thin file"" again because almost all of my previous accounts were closed with the bankruptcy, but I'm worried that applying for more credit will have a worse impact than just waiting. I could pay off my auto loan to save the interest we are paying there, but then I will be moving the number of open accounts backward. I'm also scared to death of applying for anything and being declined, especially a mortgage loan.

,CRedit,"I'm hoping I can get some tips on rebuilding my credit and really maximizing a higher score over the next six months. 

My score has drastically improved from low 300s a few years ago and is now sitting at low 600's. I removed a lot of accounts and really cleaned up my report. 

FICO 8; Experian - 604, Equifax - 620, TransUnion - 618

Most recently in the past month, I had a final collection removed from these accounts which boosted each of them to the above scores \~40 points. 

My first step was getting a secured credit card. I have the Open Sky card with a $500 limit. It first reported on my credit report a few days ago and dropped each score 3-4 points, as expected. Any suggestions on maximizing this account to grow my score quicker?

Other accounts on my report include 4 closed US Department of Education Loans.

Three of them have balances - $6,000; $5,500; and $3,300 and 47 charge offs (Im looking to start paying these again as I have the means, especially if it can help my credit score). One of them is closed with $0 balance and 13 late payments. 

I'm thinking of opening a Self Credit Builder Loan to help increase my score quicker. Does anyone have experience with this? Do you think it will help based on the above or hurt my score? Does anyone have experience if paying a larger monthly fee helps your score more or not? 

I'm hoping to raise my score by \~70 points over the next six months so I can have my score in ""Good"" status and be approved to rent an apartment on my own - no guarantor. 

Also, my bank is opening a secured card - Chime. I am close to being off the waitlist. Would another secured card hurt my credit? Is there any benefit?

,CRedit,"So, here's the story.  On January 18, 2019 my wife and I received our discharge on a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Up until the time of bankruptcy, we had never missed a single payment on anything but suddenly learned that we were facing down \~$200,000 worth of repair costs to a storm water drain system that was effecting the structural integrity of our home that we owed \~$140,000 on and was only valued at about $165,000.  We looked at all the options and decided that bankruptcy was our best option, so away we went.  
Fast forward to now, we are working to rebuild our credit so that we can purchase the house we live in now, which my wife's parents purchased and we are paying the mortgage note on.  We have a credit card that somehow survived the bankruptcy that has a $5,000 limit and I have gotten one other card with $1,000 limit.  Both have rewards points/cash back, and we run all of our purchases through them and pay the entire balance off several times a month.  My wife's vehicle is paid off, and I have an auto loan on my car that I have kept with a mind toward showing good payment habits.  The interest rate is pretty high considering the loan was gotten after the bankruptcy, but I paid a significant amount of the value in a down payment and financed a low amount of the vehicle's value with the loan, \~$6,000, just to have a payment to make.

My wife's credit score, according to credit karma, is currently in the very low 700's and mine is sitting just under 700 where it has been shifting up and down a point or two at a time depending on when the two credit card companies report the open balances.  I've had a couple of months where my balances were paid off completely at just the right time and my credit utilization was at \~2-3%, and other times that it was at \~15-25%, but we haven't paid a cent in CC interest since our ""fresh start"".

So I say all of that to ask this; I don't know what the right thing is to do next to continue to build my credit score.  We need to get our home into our name because we are missing out on the homestead tax exemption and also paying a higher interest rate than most mortgage loans because this is technically a second home for my in-laws.  I'm considered a ""thin file"" again because almost all of my previous accounts were closed with the bankruptcy, but I'm worried that applying for more credit will have a worse impact than just waiting.  I could pay off my auto loan to save the interest we are paying there, but then I will be moving the number of open accounts backward.  I'm also scared to death of applying for anything and being declined, especially a mortgage loan.

&lt;p&gt;My wife&amp;#39;s credit score, according to credit karma, is currently in the very low 700&amp;#39;s and mine is sitting just under 700 where it has been shifting up and down a point or two at a time depending on when the two credit card companies report the open balances.  I&amp;#39;ve had a couple of months where my balances were paid off completely at just the right time and my credit utilization was at ~2-3%, and other times that it was at ~15-25%, but we haven&amp;#39;t paid a cent in CC interest since our &amp;quot;fresh start&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I say all of that to ask this; I don&amp;#39;t know what the right thing is to do next to continue to build my credit score.  We need to get our home into our name because we are missing out on the homestead tax exemption and also paying a higher interest rate than most mortgage loans because this is technically a second home for my in-laws.  I&amp;#39;m considered a &amp;quot;thin file&amp;quot; again because almost all of my previous accounts were closed with the bankruptcy, but I&amp;#39;m worried that applying for more credit will have a worse impact than just waiting.  I could pay off my auto loan to save the interest we are paying there, but then I will be moving the number of open accounts backward.  I&amp;#39;m also scared to death of applying for anything and being declined, especially a mortgage loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, great people of reddit, what do you think I should do?&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"Good afternoon, 

After making several mistakes early on with student loans, I finally have my private loans taken care of, I am still paying on my federal, but its unimportant right now. 

I currently have about $375 in collections over 2 different accounts. These are accurate amounts and I owe the debt. The accounts are from when I was briefly homeless and couldn't pay off old utility bills at the time. After looking at this subreddit, it mentions a PFD as a useful tool. While I understand the process it just seems to be a headache for such a low amount. 

I am able to safely pay 100% of the debt today, and the accounts are not scheduled to roll off until late 2023. I just got a secured card and want to start upping my score from a 550. I had other collections roll off late last year, and have had no active accounts for awhile.

Last year I bought a phone on credit with one of those no interest for 1 year deals. I stupidly thought that there wouldn't be minimum payments and went 60 days delinquent. It's all paid off now, but I'm hoping to have those remarks removed.

The hard inquiry does not appear on equifax or trans-union at this point.

,CRedit,"Hello guys. I am approaching the two year post chapter 7 bankruptcy mark next month. I have been very successful in getting my credit back on track. I started out with three secured credit cards right out of bankruptcy. One secured card, my Discover IT card rolled my secured line to unsecured, refunded me the $600 deposit and increased my credit line to $1500. And that was around a year ago. Since then I have been declined time and time again for an increase.  

Here’s positive changes on my file to note:

Obtained a fourth credit card through CreditOne, an Amex card with a limit of $2200, and, an auto loan for 2.90 percent financing around six months ago. 

I mainly use my Discover IT card for the 1.5percent cash back they offer. Because I put all of my monthly expenditures on this card, I really want to keep it and increase the line, but, I have been getting declined each and every time. 

I’m kinda at that point of maybe trying again for a credit line increase, last attempt was six months ago. If I get declined, perhaps I should ditch this card and apply for another card with rewards similar to Discover. 

My FICO is 660 through Discovers credit scoring model, which is the same score my credit union used for my auto loan. My FACO (CreditKarma) is around 710 ish.

I have been trying to read up on this and I’m getting mixed reviews. 

My CK score is currently 518. Horrible. I have a few things in collections, most between 1-2 years (hard times). 

If I pay off collections account (let’s say at a lower cost), will that actually improve my score? Google says no, credit karma says by 20-25 points. 

Also do collectors really do PIF for removal? How does one go about that?

My goal is to get to 600 by December if possible. I currently have a car loan (late payments, but caught up now) and 1 Citi secured card (500 limit) with all on time payments, with a 50% util. Gonna be getting that down into the 30 range this month though. Does this goal seem reasonable if I pay off these collections? (About 5)

*All Vantage scores via SmartCredit, all FICO scores via MyFICO*

**Experian**

* Vantage - 654
* FICO8 - 692
* FICO2 - 681 (Mortgage)
* FICO Auto 8 - 654
* FICO Bankcard 8 - 707

**Equifax**

* FICO Auto 8 - 654
* FICO Bankcard 8 - 659

**TransUnion**

* FICO8 - 646
* FICO4 - 617 (Mortgage)
* FICO Auto 8 - 603
* FICO Bankcard 8 - 665

**Observations**

* Highest vantage is with Equifax, but my highest everything else is with Experian.  
* 64 point gap in the mortgage scores between Experian and TransUnion
* If I was applying for a car loan and looking at a Vantage score from Equifax (677), it would be pretty shocking to learn my TransUnion auto score is 603 (74 points lower).  
* There's 104 point gap between the highest and lowest scores on the chart.

Anyway, your mileage may vary, but there's generally lots of room for variance across two major vendors (FICO and Vantage) and a wide array of different scoring models.  They each value things differently.

&lt;p&gt;Opened Discover Card $750 limit &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have paid all cards on time in full since May 2019, score moved 514&amp;gt;650.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experian credit simulator says potential 670 after 24 months of further on time payments and reflects negatively on opening any further lines/loans etc.
Is there any way to get to 700 without waiting 3-4 years? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 3 closed accounts, quite a few late payment marks, one closed account will disappear in 2022, the other 2 probably 2026-2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also looking at getting a mortgage in 2021 my FICO 2 is 652....is that entirely  horrible in a lenders eyes?&lt;/p&gt;

,CRedit,"So, going through credit report and notice an outstanding debt from 2019 that I was pretty positive that I had paid in full.  I called the collections group that was listed on my credit report and said that file was with the a law firm.  Called the law firm (got sued on this one) told the account was still opened and owed $259 (counting interest).  I asked how that was possible, I was on a payment plan 2018/2019 and then called to pay off early in 2019.  Apparently, when the collector took the final payment, it was rejected by the firm they were hired by or his back office as it would have been an overage.  I never received a call or letter saying this and had not idea I still owed the money.  When I called I ended up getting the same collector that I had set everything up with in 2019.  According to the collector he wasn't notified either.  He then said to clear it up, I had to pay the amount.

My argument is that i made the payment in good faith, they agreed and then declined to accept the payment after they agreed to.  The account should closed as payment in full, my credit rating should be corrected or trade line removed.    The guy started to push back and said they wouldn't do it and how was I going to pay.  He changed his tune, when I said I feel this is a violation of FCRA (might fall under UDAAP) and I am going to file a complaint with the state.  He then typed up notes and said he would get back to me and see what they could do.

**Do I really have any recourse on this?**  Really it's not a money issue at this point, just pisses me off that I tried to pay it off and they cancelled the payment and didn't tell me about it and let it sit a accumulate interest.

Well, the rep (at the law firm) I talked to submitted a request to have the remainder of the money waived and the account closed as a ""settled for less"".  I called back and talked to a supervisor and told her that I never agreed to a settlement, I want this considered paid in full and back dated to 2019, when we agreed to pay it.

,CRedit,"Hello All, 

I have been following this thread for sometime and am eager to embark and start rebuilding my Credit. I am 27 Y/O and about 3 years ago started trying to rebuild my credit through Lexington Law, Self Lender and Secured Credit Cards. I was able to build myself up to a 690 and was making roughly $40,000 a year. Once again I regressed and have now fallen to a 560 with significant charge-off, etc. 

In the last year I was fortunate to gain traction in my professional pursuits and was making about $85,000 a year but due to the pandemic have been placed on furlough likely until 2021. I want to use this time to focus on rebuilding my Credit if at all possible. I have learned through the subreddit that Lexington Law and the like will never be as effective as one setting out to fix it for themselves. As such, I want to start but feel like its a massive knot that has no beginning.  

I have recently downloaded my 3 credit reports using the Annual Credit report portal and am happy to share it with anyone who can help give me a little direction.
