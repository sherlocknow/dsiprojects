,CreditCards,"I know there's already a post about SSN remark blocker placed on 7/31 at Chase have been removed, still I feel like sharing my emotional journey this month and my DP.

* FICO Score: *745-ish*
* Oldest account age:  *1 year 3 months*
* Chase 5/24 status:  *3/24 before CFU*
* Income:  *$75K*

So I applied CFU on 7/31, and no replies, called the auto line and heard 7-10 days, called recon and asked to send SSN (saying work only DHS bla bla bla). 

Sent SSN and the auto line now says 2 weeks, I thought: nice! 

And in another couple days, the auto line turned back to 7-10 days and I panicked called recon once again. Now they're saying the nonsense about SSN is invalid. Took a whole afternoon and I just gave up talking to them and let it be. (mid August)

On 8/28 they sent me the card without emailing me or adding the card to my Chase app (I opened banking accounts with them at the end of June)

It turns out that they reverted the decision and auto-reconned me! One hassle is that they created another Chase profile for CFU, so I cannot find the CFU on my banking profile at all. I had to call in, and the 2nd rep (Indian accent woman) combined 2 profiles. The craziest thing is the first rep (white male voice) picked up my phone INSISTED there's nothing he can do and I have to constantly sign in and out with 2 pairs of profile name and password, and I really raised my voice and called out his BS, he does not comply and said it's impossible to combine them...

As an expat in the US, I really appreciate the 2nd rep for looking out for fellow minorities! Even though we had a hard time understanding each other's accents!

Now I am so happy with CFU with 5x grocery, 5x lyft, 3x dining, 3x drugstore. For someone who does not drive and live in a city, I have no needs for wholesales or gas. So this card made my BofA Premium almost obsolete other than using public transit for 2% cashback, when covid made me comfortable enough to hop on again, and being in Chicago, the L lines gave me so much cringe, so many people do not wear a mask! Even the number is soaring in IL and Cook County, it is insane.

Now the question is which card should I get first to do the trifecta? Potentially upgraded CSP or CFF to be my 5th/24?

&lt;li&gt;Income:  &lt;em&gt;$75K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I applied CFU on 7/31, and no replies, called the auto line and heard 7-10 days, called recon and asked to send SSN (saying work only DHS bla bla bla). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sent SSN and the auto line now says 2 weeks, I thought: nice! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in another couple days, the auto line turned back to 7-10 days and I panicked called recon once again. Now they&amp;#39;re saying the nonsense about SSN is invalid. Took a whole afternoon and I just gave up talking to them and let it be. (mid August)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 8/28 they sent me the card without emailing me or adding the card to my Chase app (I opened banking accounts with them at the end of June)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that they reverted the decision and auto-reconned me! One hassle is that they created another Chase profile for CFU, so I cannot find the CFU on my banking profile at all. I had to call in, and the 2nd rep (Indian accent woman) combined 2 profiles. The craziest thing is the first rep (white male voice) picked up my phone INSISTED there&amp;#39;s nothing he can do and I have to constantly sign in and out with 2 pairs of profile name and password, and I really raised my voice and called out his BS, he does not comply and said it&amp;#39;s impossible to combine them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an expat in the US, I really appreciate the 2nd rep for looking out for fellow minorities! Even though we had a hard time understanding each other&amp;#39;s accents!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am so happy with CFU with 5x grocery, 5x lyft, 3x dining, 3x drugstore. For someone who does not drive and live in a city, I have no needs for wholesales or gas. So this card made my BofA Premium almost obsolete other than using public transit for 2% cashback, when covid made me comfortable enough to hop on again, and being in Chicago, the L lines gave me so much cringe, so many people do not wear a mask! Even the number is soaring in IL and Cook County, it is insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the question is which card should I get first to do the trifecta? Potentially upgraded CSP or CFF to be my 5th/24?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: confused 7-10 days and 2 weeks originally&lt;/p&gt;

In the first week of April, right when quarantine had begun, my account was hacked on the store’s company website, and my earned points were stolen to place a store pick-up order (the thief, in another state, changed my name to hers to match her photo ID at local store pickup).

As soon as I saw my emails about suspicious account activity, I called the company to report the fraud.  I waited on hold for almost an hour to finally be connected to someone who told me that the company cannot, in any circumstance, cancel orders placed online.  She told me that if the order was not picked up after 5 days, it would auto-cancel.  

The hacker picked up her order.

I am now permanently banned from shopping at this store for violating their terms of the program:  no purchases may be made for anyone besides yourself, and the woman who hacked my account was not me, so I am banned.

I was told the only way to secure my account and close it down, so the hacker could not continue to compromise my account now that she had my telephone # for store checkout, was to wait for stores to re-open after quarantine.

,CreditCards,"I have the Chase Trifecta with the CSP and I've accumulated a fair amount (100k+) of UR points over the years. I haven't had much of a specific plan for them other than to let them accumulate and at some point redeem them for a ""bigger"" travel purchase (ex. before the fun of 2020, a trip to Disney was one idea).

I know with the CSP, I have a few options when it comes to redeeming points. One is redeeming them for basically 25% off travel, another is transferring them to a travel partner which can yield more value. However, to redeem for travel, you have to pick something available through Chase, which seems like sometimes might exclude some cheaper options. Transferring to travel partners seems like a bit more work and you have to plan and future it out to some degree (maybe easy/straightforward for some, but I've never done this before.. although if the savings is significant enough, it might be worth figuring out).

With some of that background information in mind, here's my question. Would it make sense to ""liquidate"" my UR points using Pay Yourself Back to basically turn my points into cash, still get the 25% back, and throw that money in savings for whenever I'm ready for that bigger trip?

Some pros and cons I've thought of:

- I would be guaranteed to get the 25% added value easily
- Converted to cash, I wouldn't be limited to what I used this for (ex. if I wanted to book something not available through Chase)
- My points would also be ""safe"" converted to cash (ex. in the unlikely event my 10+ year old cards got cancelled, Chase does away with the points, reduces redemption value, etc. I would have already had them ""cashed in"")
- I would be missing out on potential added value by not transferring to travel partners (although I'm not sure how likely it is that I'd actually do this)
- I would no longer have a high point balance to take advantage of other new offers that might come out (but not sure what they might come out with that would really be better)
- I wouldn't have the option of upgrading to the CSR when I'm ready to book something to get 50% more value instead of 25% (this seems like maybe the biggest drawback, although I'm not sure if I would do it and I'm not sure how beneficial the added value would be after factoring in the higher annual fee)

 Is there anything I'm missing or not thinking about? What are your guys' thoughts, what would you do in this position? What have you done since Pay Yourself Back has come out?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t have the option of upgrading to the CSR when I&amp;#39;m ready to book something to get 50% more value instead of 25% (this seems like maybe the biggest drawback, although I&amp;#39;m not sure if I would do it and I&amp;#39;m not sure how beneficial the added value would be after factoring in the higher annual fee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything I&amp;#39;m missing or not thinking about? What are your guys&amp;#39; thoughts, what would you do in this position? What have you done since Pay Yourself Back has come out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I'm originally from New York, but I'm here in LA, California for college (currently in my senior year). I recently applied for my first credit card, and I listed my apartment in LA as my address (I initially wanted to receive the card here in LA but in hindsight, it would've been smarter to use my NY address).

Hello so I am in the process of trying to think about a new credit card to get. As a bit of background I am about to turn 23 and I will be getting married around when I turn 24. So as I start this new chapter I want to get a card that will give me the best rewards as I would like to travel a decent bit. However, I am living at home still because I recently graduated from college and am waiting on a job to move out. So, my first question is: should I wait to get a card as I am not sure my true spending habits by not living fully on my own yet? Or should I go for a card that matches what I believe my spending habits will be? I assume the smart thing was the first option but I want to start getting benefits and rewards that I can take advantage of. And some credit history for me is that I have the discover student card which I have had for 3 years now. Never missed a payment and always the full amount. However, I do have a fluke collections account on my credit report for a medical bill that was paid over the phone but was apparently never told that the payment didn’t go through. And the excuse to not contact me was that they had the wrong number. That has since been paid and was only like $130.

Edit/Update-  looks like I paid the Marriott annual fee in May, so I will cancel next May.  The main reason I was going to cancel was because their point redemption changed.  I used to be able to get a hotel in NYC for 50,000 points.  Right before Covid I tried to book a hotel in NYC and they wanted 153,000 for a standard room.  That’s insane- I need to spend 150,000 for one night and pay an annual fee.  No Thanks!!

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit/Update-  looks like I paid the Marriott annual fee in May, so I will cancel next May.  The main reason I was going to cancel was because their point redemption changed.  I used to be able to get a hotel in NYC for 50,000 points.  Right before Covid I tried to book a hotel in NYC and they wanted 153,000 for a standard room.  That’s insane- I need to spend 150,000 for one night and pay an annual fee.  No Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am prepaid on the delta until November as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked if they would give a prorated refund on the annual fee and the answer was nope!!!&lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"I went through a divorce semi recently where we closed a lot of store cards as well as a few credit cards.

Got a few questions that probably apply to others as well!

Need both a vehicle and personal loan at the same time for various reasons. Not a lot--about 7k for private used car sale, 3k personal. Might just get a new credit card instead if I dont qualify.

Score is solid (704) and I make about $5k per month. Very low living expenses. Problems are:


-Self employed

-Havent filed tax returns yet for 18 and 19 (extenuating reasons; about to file shortly)

-Even if I had filed, it prob wouldn't help. In 18 I made good money but in 19 I basically made zero. All freelance. Been earning $5k monthly for about 5 months now but that's only this year.


Anything I can do to maximize likelihood of qualifying? What institutions are most likely to approve this? I'm willing to pay a little bit higher rate if it means I get approved on the first try. Typically I've used USAA for car loans.

Thank you!

,CreditCards,"Hi there, I'm Brian. I've been more lurking as I work nights and enjoy reading what everyone has to say but I could use some help.

I filed bankruptcy several years ago but had a little to no balance on my only credit card, Capital One. I stopped using it but didn't close it and it's been idle until today. I randomly saw an alert from Credit Karma about a 29pt drop from Transunion due to huge utilization from Capital One I'm not even using. A balance increase of almost 2k.

Do I call them directly, or the credit bureaus? Both? With the extended wait times to due Covid-19, I didn't want to waste my time if customer service is useless, one is more beneficial than the other, etc.

My credit score was in the 400's and up until today, I got it to 694-696 between Equifax and Transunion so I hope to have this resolved before it makes more of an impact. State Dept FCU is the only active card through the American Consumer Council.

I'm also asking for anything else suggested doing to help my score in general? I didn't want to open up any other cards to borrow money but as long as I watch what I spend I'm fine, especially with the intro rewards. I am in a much better place than even a year ago and hope to exit bankruptcy in the next few months.

I filled out what I could and will come back with the rest but I wanted to ask this now as I'm running out to do some errands.

Thank you!

Brian

I plan on building a PC soon with a budget of $1000 so I am looking for a card with a sign up bonus, which will also be useful over time.

,CreditCards,"I’m just getting into the credit game, and I set a goal of getting a round trip flight to Europe in First/Business class with points, along with aligning myself to attaining a high credit score. I did a few days of research and came up with a game plan on which credit cards to apply for throughout a period of time, but I definitely wanted to run it by others, specifically people versed in Credit Cards. Some of my stats are below, and my plan is below this:

* Current cards:
   * *No personal cards, but...*
   * *Amex Platinum (\*\*AUTHORIZED USER\*\*) 2 yrs 10 months*
* Trans-Union Score: *712*
* Oldest account age: *2 yrs 10 months (\*\*AUTHORIZED USER\*\*)*
* Chase 5/24 status: *0/24*
* Open to Business Cards: *Sure*
* What's the purpose of credit cards for me, either than building credit? *Free Travel*
* Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card? I'm okay with category spending

**Step 1: CHASE Trifecta &amp; The 5/24 rule**

\- 1st card, since I bank with BOA. **Bank of America Cash Rewards Card** (Meanwhile open up a Chase bank account to build your relationship with Chase to receive the letter of recommendation before applying for the Chase card)

\- When I start buying my own food, due to the 60k points from grocery promotion: **Chase Freedom Unlimited Card** (No sooner than 6 months after you applied for the BOA card on \_\_\_\_). All spending will transfer to this card. BOA card will just receive a small rotating bill on autopay - *Like financing a vacuum and using the payments to build my credit*... #MURICA

\- **Chase Freedom Card** (No sooner than 12 months has passed from the Freedom Unlimited Card received on \_\_\_, because you want to get that double 60k points from grocery in a year bonus. Some spending will transfer from Freedom Unlimited to catch the 5% rotating categories

\- When you have a big purchase of $4000 coming up (No sooner than 8-12 months after you received the BOA card on \_\_\_\_), get the **Chase Sapphire Preferred Card**. If you don't see yourself doing much dining in the next year to take advantage of the 2x dining points, request a downgrade to the Sapphire Classic within 30 days of your annual fee posting to be eligible for a full refund

\- When you start paying for phone and internet, **Chase Ink Business Cash**. Unless you have $15,000 of expenses, then do the Chase Ink Business Preferred for the bonus, then in 12 months product switch to the Ink Business Cash to get that 5% on phone and internet.

\- Then when you start traveling, product change the Preferred/classic to the **Sapphire Reserve**

**Result:**

\- Freedom Unlimited: 20,000pts + 60,000pts = 80,000pts

\- Freedom: 20,000pts + 60,0000pts = 80,000pts

\- Sapphire Preferred: 60,000pts

\- Chase Ink Business cash: 50,000pts

\- Total, transferred to travel portal using Sapphire Reserve: **405,000 pts - A.K.A first-class round trip to Europe and a stay at the Ritz for a few nights!**

**STEP 2: AMEX (I want to stay with AMEX over Chase in the long run because I like the company more)**

\- If you have big purchases totaling $5000 coming up, get the **AMEX Platinum**. If you aren't going to be doing much traveling in the next year, cancel this card because downgrading this card to the AMEX Green will still put you out $150, and product changes from lesser cards to bigger cards with AMEX simply count as a new application. You'll just re-apply when you start traveling and can actually get profit from this card.

\- If you have big purchases totaling $4000 coming up (but can’t wait until you have $5000, or already got the Platinum), get the **AMEX Gold**. This will turn into your (if you dine) dining, and grocery card. Spending $6250/yr in groceries will break even on the annual fee of this card, so I can probably keep this one after year one.

\- If you have $2000 in purchases coming up, get the **AMEX Green**. Cancel after a year. You would already have the Gold card, so this one is entirely useless to you either than the welcome bonus

\- If you have a BIIIG purchase coming up, get the **AMEX Blue Business Plus** for a 0% APR on 12 months. Put the money in a high-yield savings account, and have it be paid off slowly. Also, replace the Freedom Unlimited with this card. Put a small bill on the Unlimited to keep it alive. This is simply another card history &amp; relationship with AMEX building card

\- A year after you get the vanilla platinum, get the **Schwab Platinum** for an extra MR Point boost. Cancel at the end of the year and make \*another\* AMEX Platinum card knife.

**Result:**

\- Amex Platinum: 60,000 - 125,000pts

\- Amex Gold: 60,000pts

\- Amex Green: 45,000pts

\- Schwab Platinum: 60,000 - 125,000pts

Total: **225,000pts - 355,000pts -** (definitely getting myself one of those $15,000 flights with these points)

&lt;p&gt;The issue is I plan on financing a car sometime within the next 3 - 6 months, and maybe a house in 3 - 5 years. I don&amp;#39;t to screw up my approval chances by making it look like I&amp;#39;m applying for too much at once, or applying for things in the wrong order which could negatively impact the finance rate or approval of a car loan by having too many new accounts with not enough payment history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing the whole picture, what&amp;#39;s the best plan of attack to get the best rate and chance of approval on the car? Additional credit card first or car loan first? And any other advice for rebuilding the credit report?&lt;/p&gt;

Today, I applied for the CFU and was denied (with the 7-10 day denial message). 

I called recon, and I was told that the denial letter I would soon receive would request that I verify my income. They asked that I send two paystubs or a W-2 for income verification. 

I immediately sent the requested documents and am now in the waiting game. There was no fudging numbers—I reported my true income. I’m thinking it was likely flagged because this is my first job ever, as I have just finished graduate school. 

Is this likely a conditional approval, provided my income matches what I reported? Or is there still a chance I will be denied?

* CFU: $110.70 (I would not use this card overseas, as my Prime card has no FTF so I did not include overseas spending for the CFU)

* CSP (with CFU): $176.65 the first year, $81.65 after that (I'd upgrade/downgrade to CSR/CF after the first year)

* CSR (Trifecta): $92.20

* AR: $135.68 (for anything I was not 100% sure would allow mobile wallet such as restaurants and overseas spending, I calculated as 1x to calculate the least I would earn with this card)

I know I calculated these in terms of cashback but I'd expect with all the cards (other than the CFU) I would use their portal.

Now in the Chase ecosystem, it appears that while I would make enough to cover the fees and then some, putting the benefits aside (and first year CSP waived), I make more back on the CFU. Though outside of these cards, I always buy travel insurance and have always wanted to use those lounges.

More and more, the AR is looking better and better to where I'm considering opening up a no-fee brokerage with them to establish a relationship with them in advance to prep for the AR (since I don't have a US Bank near me).

Now that's not to say I wouldn't use the benefits of the CSR and AR. I would absolutely love complimentary wifi (though every flight I've taken lately has had Panasonic wifi instead of gogo, so...) lounge access, TSA Global Entry and included travel insurance (I'd still buy travel ***medical*** insurance separately, but I could buy just the medical rather than a whole comprehensive plan that costs $100 extra), so those would not go unused. However, I do know that what I would gain from the card is undoubtedly minimal compared to some of the other cRedditors on here so I'm curious what other people make out with these cards after.

,CreditCards,"Hi. This is my first time posting here so sorry if I made some errors, please let me know if you find one.

I am now a Junior in high school in Southern California as a South Korean international student (NOT an exchange student), and I am getting a green card soon because of my mom’s investment thing in San Fransisco. As stated in the title, I am 17 year old and turn 18 next July.

While looking things up on Google, I found some ways to get my credit scores higher and one is churning. Take a look at what I wrote based on all those things on Google and Youtube:

——————————— THESE ARE THE THINGS I WROTE DOWN ON MY NOTE———————————————

1. Get a Chase bank account in prior to getting a green card and SSN as an international student. Use the savings account and have a certain amount of money in there for at least 6 months

2. Wait until I get the green card and become a legal permanent resident. (I think this will be around my sophomore year in college)

3. Make a secured card from USBank/ Citi/ Chase/ WF/ BoA/ Capital One/ Discover and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 750-790 is expected, but a fragile one.

4. Get a CF or CFU and use it under the 10% of my spending limit

After 6 months, a credit score of 800 or near that is expected, but still a fragile one.

5. Get credit cards from each companies (Amex, Chase, BofA)

After 6 months, I would be able to lease a Honda  Accord or Toyota Camry (Maybe?)

- The credit score can easily go down, so I have to have a mortgage or a car loan to make it a sturdy credit score
- Try to do things above online not on the phone or in person unless the bank calls you or bank wants you to call them
- I can use other cards from Korea or use my debit card when I can’t use my credit cards because of the limit

,CreditCards,"Hi everyone,

I just recently got approved for my first credit card on august 7th. My credit card company charged a $35.00 joining fee on august 7th as well. I made my first purchase the day I got my card (8/18) for $3.33 and haven't used it since due to my credit line being $300 and not wanting to have a high credit utilization. My question is: When do I make my first payment? The app that I use to check all my information has a blank by my payment due date and says my minimum payment due is $0.00. I don't want to miss a payment or something just because I don't know when to pay, but I also don't want to pay too early and not have my credit usage reported to the bureaus. Am i supposed to wait until I receive my statement? I feel like I have 85% of the information I need about credit, but just need someone to help fill some of the gaps in my knowledge.

,CreditCards,"It would be interesting to know which method you found is better to pay credit card balance and why.

From my perspective:

* Debit card. The obvious disadvantage is that a fairly small number of credit companies are allowed to use this method. But the big advantage is safety and speed. It is also a chance to get cashback for paying your credit card bill. For example, at The Home Depot, it is possible to pay their Citi credit card balance with a Discover debit card and get 1% cashback.
* ACH debit. The typical advantage is that the payment is initiated by the credit institution, and even if ACH can be really slow, payment still will be considered credited on the same day when you submit a request. A small drawback can probably be the need to provide data and access to your checking/saving account to your credit institution. 
* ACH credit (with services like Bill Pay). The advantage is that you do not need to provide your account details to the credit institution. In some cases, it is convenient that, unlike the methods above, it is possible to overpay and cause a negative balance. This can be useful for people with a small credit limit or in rare situations when there is a risk that a large transaction on a credit card will be cleared on statement date (which can cause a report of big utilization and drop of credit score for this month). The downside is the difficulty in controlling the date when payment will be credited (as it is not initiated by credit card company). Some Bill Pay services may also send a check to payee instead of electronic transfer which can be unpredictable slow.

Some users may prefer to pay in cash or send paper checks.

,CreditCards,"Hi Everyone,

I have a quick consultation for Chase CC users in this reddit.  I noticed that my personal Chase credit cards have 3 days gap between Due Date (DD) and Statement Date (SD). I chose to consolidate my DDs on the 25th of each month, therefore their Statement Dates are on the 28th.

 I am trying to do the same for my Chase Ink Cash (business), however I noticed that the time gap between DD and SD is 6 days instead. My current due date is on the 16th and my statement date is the 22nd.

1. Do you guys have very similar time gap in your Chase business cards?
2. If I'm trying to match my statement date to the 28th, do you think I should change my due date to 25th or 22nd?

Discover actually upgraded my card to the travel one a couple of years ago without me enquiring, which would be great except Discover isn't widely accepted overseas.

Inevitably I end up using my BofA card when I travel, the last trip was to the UK and Spain, and the foreign transaction fees add up quite quickly. 

In 2017 I applied for the BofA Travel Rewards card and was denied because ""you already have a credit card with us"" or something along those lines. I haven't applied or been rejected by any other credit cards.

I hadn't realized I could potentially ""upgrade"" the card, I just saw a few posts mentioning that. Could anyone tell me a bit more about the process and if it's likely they'll accept?

I'm also planning on closing my BofA savings account and just maintaining the checking account, that wouldn't affect anything would it?

,CreditCards,"Hello!

So the title says it all. I’m heavily considering trying the AMEX Gold card as my main credit card instead of the AMEX Everyday I’m currently using. If I make this change, I’m also considering simply canceling the everyday card so I all of my focus can be on the gold, since I feel a little funky about having multiple credit cards open, especially for my lifestyle. 

If I do this, I originally was planning to cancel the everyday card and apply for the gold (no promises I’d be accepted of course) but was reading that AMEX apparently doesn’t like recent cancelations when applying for new cards. Does that mean it would be better to apply first and, if accepted, then cancel the old card?

I should mention that if it comes down to it, I’m sure I can be convinced to keep both cards open as well. You’re all the experts. I have an idea how this might go but it’s based on knowing nothing about the process. 

Thank you for your input!

EDIT: Thank you all again for your input! It looks like canceling the everyday card isn’t the way to go, so I’m gonna keep that one activated.

Chase 5/24 status: 1/24

Income: $60,000

Hey all,

I'm 20 and looking to get another credit card after having my Discover for almost a year.  Planning to apply for the CF in October(so &gt;1 of credit history), but I'm not sure how to list my income.  The work I currently have isn't consistent, currently I'm expecting to make ~$60,000 overall this year, but if I apply in October, the two or three most recent paystubs would make it look like my annual income should be closer to $100,000(i.e. $4,000 biweekly).  Will this be a red flag to Chase if my listed income is $60,000, or is it not likely to be an issue? 

Thanks in advance for any advice!",t2_7wg21c3o,False,,0,False,CF Income Question,[],r/CreditCards,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ij0q1f,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Card Advice,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598765780.0,text,6,,,text,self.CreditCards,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current cards:&lt;/p&gt;

Due to being able to work remotely, we are moving but need to come back \~20 times per year.

This likely **won't begin until for 4-6 months** due to the difficulty of traveling/seeing houses due to COVID. So I'll want something that I won't lose points quickly.

I will be flying on **American Airlines**  almost exclusively due to pretty much being the only direct flight.

I have a strange occurrence this month. I have a credit card that I use basically only for Costco and occasionally Albertson's (grocery stores for this unfamiliar).

Back in February when my card was up for renewal, I product changed my Sapphire Preferred into a Sapphire Reserve, and when I did so I sent a secured message to Chase asking whether I'd qualify for the old annual fee or if I'd be charged the new annual fee.

Well, Chase waited until June to charge me the annual fee, so it's no surprise that it came in at $550.

I recently just 18, and wanted to get a head start on credit. So I applied and got accepted for 2 cards, Discover IT ($500 credit limit) and BOFA cash rewards ($1000 credit limit).

First, I am aware that I made a mistake by applying to these two cards in the same day. These were my first two cards, so I imagine that it took a temporary toll on my (new and blank) credit history.

Anyways, I want to make sure I register for a chase credit card, so I can get started with their ecosystem (bc of the limitations of the 05/24 rule.) 

When would the best time be to apply for another card assuming I pay all of my cards on time and keep a good/great credit rating? In other words, how long should I wait to be safe?

I have a Ch7 from Spring 2014. Burned the following:
* Barclays x2
* Amex x2
* Citibank

Since then, I’ve had no bad marks at all and 3 inquiries reporting. I have no balances and the following credit lines:
* Amazon Store: $6,000
* Dell Store: $4,500
* Best Buy Citi: $5,500
* Discover: $2,400
* Kohl’s: $3,000
* Apple Card: $6,000

My understanding is that Chase will decline until the BK is off, even though I didn’t burn them. AMEX will never approve, ever. And Citibank will also decline even though I have a store card.

... A reduced credit card limit can have a very real effect on consumers by  affecting their credit score. That's because credit scores are partially  based on the amount of credit that a consumer is using, with a lower  ""utilization rate"" resulting in a higher score. For instance, a consumer  with $10,000 credit limit and a $3,000 balance on their card has a 30%  utilization rate. But if their credit limit is halved to $5,000, their  utilization rate jumps to 60%, which could reduce their credit score.""",t2_1hl1i680,False,,0,False,Confirmed: Capital One is gutting FICO scores of loyal customers,[],r/CreditCards,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iinfhc,False,dark,0.26,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598709709.0,text,6,,,text,self.CreditCards,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like I&amp;#39;m not the only one.

Most of my money is spent on online shopping, gas, and food.

The issue was that there was no refunds listed in the terms and conditions, but that information was not listed anywhere on the website. When I opened up the class it was low-quality, including audio and visual production issues. I asked for a refund and was told no, the merchant cited that no refunds was listed in the terms and conditions I agree to when paying.

 then I took it to a credit card dispute where the agent told me that since the no refunds was in the terms and conditions, it was not likely I would be able to win the dispute. Then I decided to give up and just do the class even though it would be begrudgingly, and I notified the owner of the business who made the training and I had requested to cancel the dispute and I sent her a forward an email from the credit card company stating this.

Just wanted to share a story about downgrading my capital one venture rewards. I had the card for over a year and saw the fee hit my statement. I called in to downgrade and they offered to waive the fee to keep the card one more year. I still decided to downgrade (I don't use the card at all, just wanted the SUB). I downgraded to the ventureOne rewards card with no AF.

I just called in and the process was very easy. Didn't have to be the AF at all and the new card is in the mail today.

,CreditCards,"So over the past 8 months, I have managed to get my Experian Fico 8, from 596 to 736. After the debacle of 2008, and defaulting on everything in the few years after, my FIRST NEW CARD started reporting in JAN 2020.

NO BKs, NO public stuff, and 1 collection (removed). Done everything I can with aggressive challenging of old negatives, and extremely good behavior with new cards. Everything paid on time, no interest-incurring monthly balances left, and &lt;10% utilization by statement time.

However, I noticed that in the past 3-4 months, the score has floated in the 720's/730's..... so now I am wondering if the trajectory starts to slow and dip and go snakelike, with little ups and downs.

The 140 points/8 months has surprised and impressed me, BUT it seems that things slow way down when you get to the 720's-750's area.

They say that Age of Accounts makes up only 10-15% of scoring models, but I cannot help but be suspicious that it becomes more important than that, the closer you get to 800 (and it's the one thing that no one can manipulate). I have an old paid-in-full mortgage and p.i.f. car loan that still show. Otherwise, everything is 2020 fresh.

**So the question (somewhat arbitrary and guessing): will this take another 8 months to get only 30 points higher (say 760/770), and another 8 months or 1 year after that, to hope for another 30 points, to 800 ??**",t2_3u6tx2qs,False,,0,False,Credit Score Trajectory Question,[],r/CreditCards,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihwp4g,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Help,False,1,,False,,1598574296.0,,[],{},,True,,1598602015.0,text,6,,,text,self.CreditCards,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So over the past 8 months, I have managed to get my Experian Fico 8, from 596 to 736.

Everything paid on time, no interest-incurring monthly balances left, and &amp;lt;10% utilization by statement time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I noticed that in the past 3-4 months, the score has floated in the 720&amp;#39;s/730&amp;#39;s..... so now I am wondering if the trajectory starts to slow and dip and go snakelike, with little ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 140 points/8 months has surprised and impressed me, BUT it seems that things slow way down when you get to the 720&amp;#39;s-750&amp;#39;s area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say that Age of Accounts makes up only 10-15% of scoring models, but I cannot help but be suspicious that it becomes more important than that, the closer you get to 800 (and it&amp;#39;s the one thing that no one can manipulate). I have an old paid-in-full mortgage and p.i.f. car loan that still show. Otherwise, everything is 2020 fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the question (somewhat arbitrary and guessing): will this take another 8 months to get only 30 points higher (say 760/770), and another 8 months or 1 year after that, to hope for another 30 points, to 800 ??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"Hi all, 

I have a question about the Citi Double Cash. 

I know it’s one of the best cash back cards out there. However one of the reasons I’ve avoided using it is because you need a minimum of $25 in rewards to redeem. I’ve always shied away since I prefer flexibility and have low spend to begin with. 

So my question is once you hit $25, can you redeem any amount, or does it need to be in increments of $25? 

I guess another question I have is about redeeming it for cash back. If I have a chase account can I withdraw to my bank? Or do I need an account with Citi to do that?

,CreditCards,"My girlfriend recently got a credit card in the month of July that was promoted for helping to rebuild credit. Yesterday, as we were discussing credit cards and building our credit score, I had told her Graham Stephan recommended opening a new no annual fee credit card every 8-12 months. She then realized that the credit card she signed up for had a high annual fee of $75.

The card is Credit One Bank's Platinum Visa for Rebuilding Credit. I think it would be less costly and more effective for her to start tacking on more no annual fee credit cards. But we're not quite sure what to do with this annual fee credit card. The benefits don't seem to be that great. I read that you normally don't want to close any credit cards, but this is costing her $75 she could be saving every year.

I recommended she opens a no annual fee Discover It Student Chrome card while she's still in school. The problem is she had just opened up this annual fee card just last month. She has had 3 hard inquiries in the past 2 years according to [mint.com](https://mint.com). And her credit score is within the 600-650 range. We're worried that this ding to her credit might be for naught if she doesn't get accepted for this student card. I would assume creditors are more likely to be forgiving toward students (please correct me if I'm wrong). But then again, Graham Stephen said that Hard Inquiries only account for 10% of your credit score.

She said she is planning to pay off her balance in full this Friday. We decided since she already paid the annual fee for this year, to keep the card for one year, and then right before she has to pay the annual fee, call up Credit One and attempt to negotiate waiving the annual fee, and if they won't do it, then to finally just close the card.

1. Should she apply for the student card ASAP? In a few months? Or if there is any other cards you guys recommend, that would be amazing!
2. Should she close the annual fee card or just put up with the $75 if she can't get the annual fee waived?
3. Is any of the advice I've given her or assumptions I made wrong or risky? Let me know, so I can tell her.

,CreditCards,"Hi there!

So I recently switched from my iPhone to a Samsung. I'm debating on whether or not I should cancel my old card. It has a lot of recurring bills that I'm switching over to my new Chase Freedom Unlimited.

&amp;#x200B;

My thought is that if I keep the card I will have a higher credit limit, therefore better for my score. I'm just worried because I don't want to have to keep track of it just in case I miss a subscription.

&lt;p&gt;So I recently switched from my iPhone to a Samsung. I&amp;#39;m debating on whether or not I should cancel my old card. It has a lot of recurring bills that I&amp;#39;m switching over to my new Chase Freedom Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought is that if I keep the card I will have a higher credit limit, therefore better for my score. I&amp;#39;m just worried because I don&amp;#39;t want to have to keep track of it just in case I miss a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"Hi, I have spent 16 years building excellent credit (around 785) and then a combination of over-investing in a house flip, tax increases, and the covid related salary cuts have stacked with all the banks slashing credit lines, and so I've been hacked do to 625 and I am not sure how best to consolidate the credit cards and keep the ship upright for 9-12 months.

,CreditCards,"EDIT: I went with the Discover It card. I figured I'd rather have a card I can have for life and worst case I just use cash. Thanks for the advice!

So I'm a senior and I have yet to get a credit card. I'm looking at student cards because I have no credit history, and so far I've been rejected from the Capital One Journey card because of insufficient income ($6k, which I thought would be okay). Anyways, I know Discover is far and away the most popular starter card and I really wanted to go with it, but there's a chance I study abroad next semester (assuming a vaccine comes and the UK lets me in). I know Discover is basically not viable overseas unless you have a backup card, and my dad is concerned about that.

My question then is, should I go with a secured card? Capital One has one but I've heard they sometimes don't upgrade you to an un-secured card and I don't want to cancel a card for that security deposit and affect my credit score.

That seems to be my best option from a company that has a functional app and is generally trustworthy. Otherwise, is there a way to go with a discover card and still be in a good position overseas?

So I've been working on building up my credit since I turned 18 and my first step was opening a card with BoA. I've had the BoA Cash Rewards Card since early February ($300 limit since I opened it secured at first) and according to Boa/TransUnion I'm currently at a 740. One of the things the TransUnion report mentions as bringing down my score is the length of the accounts I have open and a lack of different sources of credit. Other than my BoA card all I have is a Federal Govt. Student Loan for $5,000. I was wondering if due to this it would be worth opening a second card, and if so if anyone has any recommendations.

Hi folks been reading this site for a few weeks - first time post. Tons of great stuff on here. 

I wanted to get into the no AF game and start the Chase trifecta and start with the UR game. I applied for the CFU this morning and was denied. I called Chase Recon and spent almost 30 minutes on the phone but got the new card approved. I was nervous since I had opened two new cards this year and wanted to get into Chase w/ 5/24 approaching.

It's coming up on six months since my last application and...the world has changed a lot. All my Delta trips got canceled in the spring and I'm left holding my lovely new Delta Gold card, a bucket of SkyMiles and Delta eCredit...and exactly zero travel plans. Whoops.

I think cash rewards, customer-focused service, and simplicity are probably my goals now. The Altitude Go is appealing because it consolidates the vast majority of my spending on a single card, plus has no foreign transation fees (althoug the Amazon card and Delta both have this). A little concerned about my February inquiry in regards to applying, but I have a long-standing and good relationship with the bank as my primary bank, so I hope they'd be nice to me. \^\_\^

That being said, the Altitude Go's benefits are largely replicated with my existing card setup, so it's not like I need it. The signup bonus is nice, but not enormous. Chase and Amex have good customer service. Would deepening a relationship with them now benefit me in the future if I wanted stronger travel cards? Hard to make plans when you have no idea what the world would look like. I have no issues with annual fees, but I'm not ready for fancy travel cards right now.

,CreditCards," 

Only recently started looking into improving credit health and setting myself up for the long term. I made some mistakes 4 or 5 years ago and closed a capital one/discover card with collections. I believe I also had an issue where I closed a citi DC card,so I am unsure if I'm blacklisted from Citi, but I can't find it anywhere on my credit report, so it may have dropped off by now, that being said I did get denied for a citi DC recently and may have to call to confirm.

I got the CSP because I am planning a trip and got the 60k SUB the first month. I have never had a card worth using before, but would like to start getting something back. I have 5 hard inquiries recently (auto loan, credit cards), so will likely wait 3-6 months before applying, but would like to have a plan.

Is this legal?  I thought they were required by law  to apply payments above the minimum to higher interest balances first.&lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"Hello,

I am aiming to apply for a CSP at the beginning of next year as I anticipate some payments that may help me get the 60K points bonus when spending 4000$ within 3 months.

However I have only recently started my credit record and I have a Equifax/Transunion score of 700 and I am thinking of getting the Chase Freedom because it has no annual fee and to establish a relationship with Chase that will help when the time comes for me to apply for the CSP.

However, I do not want to lose the 60K bonus offer so does anyone know if getting a freedom card affects that offer or if there's any clause that will disqualify me of that offer since I am interested in the bonus points more than just getting a new card (The freedom will just be a means to the CSP end)?

,CreditCards,"Hi there, I'm seeking advice for the continued path in the journey of credit cards. Specifically looking for the next card or two to target as I've been able to spend time and research more about finances over the last few months. I applied for and got the Freedom card recently (went with it over the CFU as I knew I had some Amazon purchases to make).

Also some background: The no-brainer option would seem to be Chase Sapphire R / P, but...I've had Amex Gold for a few years and really haven't used many points (I have like 200k+ points racked up). I recall getting the Gold before the Sapphire was really seen as popular, and while both are great for no foreign transaction fees, the biggest gripe with Amex is that it's not accepted as widely around the world. The Gold is pretty much my ""catch-all"" card.

I'm not opposed to another annual fee card, but harder to justify if I am spending more than the benefits. Also I would open to getting a new card then closing within a year or two, but I don't have experience with that and not certain of what the implications might be!

Worth noting that my general philosophy is long-term/maximizing savings; also that I tend to travel for work, though mainly incur dining costs (\[un\]fortunately work usually covers the flights + hotels instead of reimbursements).

Specifically looking for the next card or two to target as I&amp;#39;ve been able to spend time and research more about finances over the last few months. I applied for and got the Freedom card recently (went with it over the CFU as I knew I had some Amazon purchases to make).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also some background: The no-brainer option would seem to be Chase Sapphire R / P, but...I&amp;#39;ve had Amex Gold for a few years and really haven&amp;#39;t used many points (I have like 200k+ points racked up). I recall getting the Gold before the Sapphire was really seen as popular, and while both are great for no foreign transaction fees, the biggest gripe with Amex is that it&amp;#39;s not accepted as widely around the world. The Gold is pretty much my &amp;quot;catch-all&amp;quot; card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not opposed to another annual fee card, but harder to justify if I am spending more than the benefits. Also I would open to getting a new card then closing within a year or two, but I don&amp;#39;t have experience with that and not certain of what the implications might be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Current cards:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Local bank card, no rewards] $12,000 limit, August 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,CreditCards,"My initial plan was to keep saving my points and utilize them for travel, however, with COVID and the new ""pay yourself back incentive,"" it seems as though the 1.5 cents per point is roughly equal to what Id be getting through the Chase travel portal (give or take). So...

I plan to (spread out over a couple days if there is a daily spend limit) go to Home Depot and buy $15,000 worth of Amazon/Home Depot gift cards then use the 1,000,000 points to pay myself back. I already asked Chase and they said I can do this.

My question for anyone else who has done something like this with their points is would there be a better way to maximize point value (i.e. store gift card incentives, etc,) to buy gift cards? Also, I know chase had a 5x per point spend at grocery stores recently which is now no longer an option. With a $15000 purchase, that would have been an extra 750 dollars as opposed to the 150 I will get if I make my move today (at 1x per point).

Thanks in advance. I just want to be sure I'm spending this large amount of points the best way I can.

&amp;#x200B;

\[EDIT\]

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the suggestions/comments thus far.

To clarify, I do have the CSR card.

&amp;#x200B;

When I saw Chase's offer to ""pay yourself back"" at 1.5 cents per point, I thought that would almost effectively be as good as using the points through the travel portal. In that case, I could see way more opportunities to spend the money than on travel. As long as I'm getting equal value which some have pointed out I would not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this wasn't meant to be a post about earning points with gift card spend, but more about using the points I already have to cover the gift card purchase. Obviously, there would be an ancillary benefit of earning extra points with my 15k spend but that is secondary to what I am trying to accomplish.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

\[EDIT 2\]

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like many have pointed out that there is still way more value (if I spend the time) transferring the points to travel partners. I think that will be what I end up doing. The 1.5 cent ""pay yourself back"" offer right now did seem tempting as a way to quickly cash out (effectively earning 2.25% on my credit card purchases thus far) and not lose out on the 50 percent savings.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll soon become a student with a huge tuition payment and I would like to know which credit cards I should go for to not waste that tuition payment opportunity and hit the minimum spend in one go? I will be making partial payments on my tuition that cost +-$15,000 per semester (international student) for 2 years or 4 semesters ($15,000 x 4= $60,000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently am in the beginning stage of the credit card game, under 5/24 rule, and have CSP, and AMEX Gold, and BoA travel rewards and cashback. (approved for Chase Freedom) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to start a hotel card (for anniversary night) if applicable, saw AskShebby&amp;#39;s video and was interested to see how everyone else thinks.

,CreditCards,"Tl;dr have a gold card, bank offered me a black card recently and I took it, now planning to cancel the gold card to keep only 1. Will it screw my credit score? 

Almost exactly a year ago, I got into a new company. They opened an account for me in Scotiabank. The company has a Scotiabank account executive assigned to it and he offered me the option to get one of their Gold cards at no additional cost, and with 1 year of refundable annual fee.
I took the offer and got the card. I used it regularly and I have never missed a payment. Always keep it on 0 before the deadline.

Now, last week I got a call from the bank telling me that due to my excellent score, they wanted to offer me a MasterCard Black Card, again with 1 year free of annual fee.
I checked the benefits and they were much better than those from the Gold Card. I accepted the offer and got the black card.
I asked the bank rep if I could cancel the gold card now That I have the black card and he told me ""well...due to personal ethics I can tell you that you *can*, but that's not the idea. The bank offers you these new cards in hopes you have more products with us.""

That kind of worried me. I haven't yet taken advantage of the refundable annual fee on the gold card, and I'm even planning on emigrating within a year, so I'll probably won't even keep the black card for a year because I'll just close my account.

In other words, I would most likely not be paying the annual fee for either of the cards. That does give me the impression that it would ruin my credit but I'm not sure? Like I said I've never had a single late fee and always pay all my purchases almost immediately after buying them. The cards would be at 0 upon cancelation.

,CreditCards,"Hi all,

I'm wondering, assuming that I need to transfer 150K from MR to partners, what are the superior transfer partners for US domestic travel, that ALSO get you a more or less guaranteed seat in Economy Plus / Comfort+ (more legroom, perhaps some perks).  I have Amex Plat, if that helps.

I'm keeping in mind that travel is sort of dead right now and that the booking sweet spots have changed (4 weeks out seems good, 8 weeks out seems overpriced).

I know that Singapore and British Airways is good for booking some rewards like US West to Hawaii for \~12-15K points one way, etc, on domestic US flights with US carriers.  I have not been able to easily see/book travel, or see available seating charts -- I don't have have enough points right now to get as far as seating charts, but I **haven't seen any** **Econ. Plus** options at all on BA, Singapore or Virgin, for let's say LA to NYC, or LA to Hawaii -- only regular econ. seats.  Are you supposed to book directly through their sites?

Another decent looking option is Delta.  And their website lets you see all of their Comfort+ bookings, and sometimes for great value!

What about immediate or other similarly guaranteed options?  Such as the use of the $200 Plat credit or otherwise cheap upgrade to Econ. Plus?  (Need the leg/knee room :).  Perhaps immediately logging in after the purchase of a regular econ seat and getting an upgrade.  How would I know if it's available?

I'm hoping to avoid ""let's hope"" scenarios like trying to upgrade in the last 24 hours before the flight (although if the circumstances are that last 24h upgrades are almost guaranteed for some reason, I would love to hear about that too.)

Like I said, I don’t spend too much which is why I didn’t apply for chase freedom because I don’t see myself utilizing the 5% quarterly categories. &lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"Hello, using an alternate account as I don't want these details tied to my normal account.

I own a small business and we put on average around $60,000/month on our CapitalOne Spark Business card (2% travel points). I also spend around $4,000/month on my personal CapitalOne Venture card (2% travel points). So in total I am earning \~128,000 points/month

I combine these points and use them for travel/Ubers/etc but at the rate I accumulate them I still have around 1.8 Million Points in my account and growing.

I just received notice that the Spark card is being converted from Visa to Mastercard here soon. And while I'm sure that I wouldn't have any issues switching almost all my payments over to that new card, I'm wondering if perhaps it makes sense for me to start putting this spend on another card. I can travel off the 1.8M miles for a while and my personal Visa will still earn \~8,000/mo.

So I'm wondering if anyone here has any suggestions about other credit cards that exist out there for relatively large spenders and what kind of unique benefits/rewards I could get?

\- I have avoided doing Cash-Back to this point largely because I feel that would be a more obviously taxable scenario than the travel points. Yes I am aware those are certainly still taxable.

\- I'm not a huge traveler. Maybe 3-4 trips/year. So I'm not sure more travel benefits make sense.

,CreditCards,"   Hi, looking for some advice on whether it is worth it to attempt an app for a US Bank card, specifically the US Bank Cash+ some time around December 2020. I have most daily spending categories covered by the cards that I already hold, but the 5% back on utilities and internet is attractive, as I don't have a catch-all card at the moment. The extra gains will be at most $50 annually, but I am interested in the Altitude Reserve which requires a relationship with US Bank, and this card seems like a card that I would keep indefinitely.

I've been reading that under 30% is a good UTIL. I started recently working on my credit. I paid down my debt from 110% to 44% UTIL. I actually thought I paid it down to 22% but I didn't realize my closed credit cards with balances were counted in my UTIL on my credit report. No charge offs. I paid some loans off too.

I would like to get a home in the next six months to a year with my VA loan. I wanted to know should I make my open accounts under 10% UTIL? Or lower the UTIL on the closed CCs?  I don't know what looks good to a mortgage lender.

I get an updated myfico 3B at the end of the week to see what my new scores are. I believe I should get a big jump. My scores before paydown are.

,CreditCards,"[Disclaimer - I have Citi Double Cash card, not sure about any other Citi cards &amp; VANs, apologies.]

This is maybe a stupid thing to be inordinately excited about (I'm probably one of like 5 people who even cares about Virtual Account Numbers), but I've been using Citi's VANs for years now. I love them for peace of mind for trial accounts and shopping on random ecommerce sites on the internet. I've also had my CC number stolen once in the past and it was a relatively annoying headache closing the card, waiting for a new card to ship, etc. - so again, just nice knowing one-time numbers help prevent that.

Anyhow, this year's been a minor headache trying to get Citi's Virtual Account Numbers to work - their landing page which used to launch the app popup stopped working, and I had to [visit the Flash app directly](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/e3kl4i/citi_virtual_account_number_windows_app_not/flxhkn0/) as a wacky workaround. I use a Mac, not a PC, so I couldn't even try their desktop app (which reportedly also stopped working anyway).

Today I tried accessing the VAN app directly again and was continuously getting redirected to a benefits landing page. I was super sad thinking they'd finally fully discontinued VANs but when I finally tried opening the app via [the landing page](https://online.citi.com/US/ag/repcard/van/landing), to my complete shock, a brand-new non-Flash app popped up! It works the same as before (you can set $/time limits) but is an actual modern Javascript SPA now it looks like (Angular, not React - gotta love the fintech sector still being a good 5 years behind current web trends :)

&lt;p&gt;This is maybe a stupid thing to be inordinately excited about (I&amp;#39;m probably one of like 5 people who even cares about Virtual Account Numbers), but I&amp;#39;ve been using Citi&amp;#39;s VANs for years now. I love them for peace of mind for trial accounts and shopping on random ecommerce sites on the internet. I&amp;#39;ve also had my CC number stolen once in the past and it was a relatively annoying headache closing the card, waiting for a new card to ship, etc. - so again, just nice knowing one-time numbers help prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, this year&amp;#39;s been a minor headache trying to get Citi&amp;#39;s Virtual Account Numbers to work - their landing page which used to launch the app popup stopped working, and I had to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/e3kl4i/citi_virtual_account_number_windows_app_not/flxhkn0/""&gt;visit the Flash app directly&lt;/a&gt; as a wacky workaround. I use a Mac, not a PC, so I couldn&amp;#39;t even try their desktop app (which reportedly also stopped working anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I tried accessing the VAN app directly again and was continuously getting redirected to a benefits landing page. I was super sad thinking they&amp;#39;d finally fully discontinued VANs but when I finally tried opening the app via &lt;a href=""https://online.citi.com/US/ag/repcard/van/landing""&gt;the landing page&lt;/a&gt;, to my complete shock, a brand-new non-Flash app popped up! It works the same as before (you can set $/time limits) but is an actual modern Javascript SPA now it looks like (Angular, not React - gotta love the fintech sector still being a good 5 years behind current web trends :)&lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"I’ve had a Capital One Secured Card for just under 2 years (22 months) and I haven’t received a limit increase or a transfer to an unsecured card. I call all the time and inquire and they tell me I’m ineligible.

My secured card limit is $300. When I initially got the card my credit was very very bad from a delinquent student credit card I had when I was 17 that had been sent to collections and stayed there for 5+ years before I decided to do anything about it. 

My credit has slowly been building back up and my scores are (590 Equifax) and (660 TransU). I don’t qualify for any other unsecured cards and it’s driving me crazy that I can’t get my credit score up on Equifax. I’m thinking about sending in more secured funds to capital one to increase my limit and hopefully show I can handle a higher credit limit. 

Unfortunately, I have no knowledge about whether or not this will be beneficial or worth it. If I were to send in more funds to increase my credit limit, how much should I send? $200 to increase my limit to $500? $400 to increase my limit to $700? or $700 to increase my limit to $1000? Does it even matter? At this point I will do anything to increase my score. I just want to be approved for a regular card in the near future and set myself to be able to be approved for things. 
Please give me your wisdom.

TLDR: I have a secured card with a very low amount. Need tips to try and increase my credit limit because my credit score is moving up at an incredibly slow place.

I call all the time and inquire and they tell me I’m ineligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My secured card limit is $300. When I initially got the card my credit was very very bad from a delinquent student credit card I had when I was 17 that had been sent to collections and stayed there for 5+ years before I decided to do anything about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My credit has slowly been building back up and my scores are (590 Equifax) and (660 TransU). I don’t qualify for any other unsecured cards and it’s driving me crazy that I can’t get my credit score up on Equifax. I’m thinking about sending in more secured funds to capital one to increase my limit and hopefully show I can handle a higher credit limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use my checking account to pay for my Citi Costco credit card. 3 days ago, I made a payment of $600 towards it. On the Citi side, it says the transaction has been posted 2 days ago and the payment was accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on the checking account side, there are no transactions stating I transfered any of the money, pending or posted. My account still states I have &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; amount of money, even though I technically don&amp;#39;t have that $600 I paid towards my credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"While searching the forum I never ran across this little known trick to maximize your points to increase their cash back value by 15-40%! 

A lot of cards have different ways of doubling, tripling  or even quadrupling your points by making certain purchases. Example: I have a Amex Gold card that gives me 4x points on Groceries, restaurants. But normally only get a 1 to 1 point redemption on travel. (Don’t know about you guys, I haven’t traveled much during Covid-19)

Here’s the trick!

If I were to simply use my earned points on a recent grocery purchase they only give me roughly 60% point ratio not a true 1 to 1 ratio. So my 75,000 points are not worth $750 cash back but rather $450 on purchase redemptions and only 50% on a direct cash gift cards from Amex. 

Now, Amex lets you redeem your points for gift cards at different stores on Amex website. The point ratio is 60% to 100% depending on company you select. I recently selected a $500 Home Depot Gift Card as it was a 1 to 1 point cost. So $500 only cost me 50,000 points. 

Now, you might be thinking well yeah Reddit stranger but I don’t need a $500 gift card from Home Depot... So here’s the final step. Sell that gift card to a reputable site like CardCash. They gave me $435 cash instantly! So yeah, I’m out $65 but keep in mind Amex was only going to give me 50% on a direct Amex gift card or 60% on a purchase redemption. CardCash gave me equivalent of 87%!  I also have a US Bank Altitude Reserve card and it works exactly the same with them but there points are generally a 1 to 1 point redemption on all purchases anyways.

,CreditCards,"Hi all, I was approved for the Chase Freedom on 2020-08-19. I was planning to apply for another card (specifically the Amex BCE) in a couple weeks, but now I'm seeing I may need to wait a lot longer than that.

* **Current cards:**
  * TD Cash, $650 limit, opened August 2019 (&gt;1 year)
  * Chase Freedom, $1,300 limit, opened August 2020
* **FICO Score:** 731 Experian FICO 8. Current utilization is 0%. Score should increase a little bit next month. No derogatory marks.
* **Oldest account age:** 12 months
* **Income:** $17,000
* No debt, fortunately.

I'm planning a single big purchase on Amazon, $900–$1500, in the middle of September (Nvidia Ampere!), and would like to put it on a new Amex BCE to get $350 back via the SUB. I'm going to pay it off immediately but I understand this is liable to piss Amex off, so I need some time to put spend on it beforehand so the big purchase isn't a total shock to them. Even if I prepay part of it by overpaying a balance by a few hundred dollars (assuming that's possible), is this just an inherently stupid idea with a new card in these times?

I've heard it's likely the item I want to buy will be incredibly difficult to get hold of at launch and could remain so for at least a month or two, so that would give me some more time to not be doing this with a totally new card, or to wait longer to apply for the new card, but probably not enough time to do both of those. Particularly in the latter case, I *might* be able to get to three months between cards, but definitely not six, so maybe I should just plan to put this purchase on a debit? What do y'all think?

,CreditCards,"The title pretty much sum it up: Discover will not give me a credit line increase with my current limit being stuck at $1,000.

I've been a Discover member for about 20 months now after my first and only Discover card, the Discover IT Secured, account opened in December 2018. This was my first credit account period. When I first opened that secured account, I set it up with a limit of $300. In about 7 months(July 2019), they graduated me to a unsecured card and sent me my initial $300 deposit back. I never asked for a CLI after that because at the time I didn't know the benefits of asking for one and just assumed that I was stuck with this measly $300 until they automatically gave me some more.

In January 2020, they automatically increased my limit from $300 to $1,000! While this wasn't much of a bump, I was still stoked because they automatically did this without me asking and this was my first card to do so. But since then, I have been unsuccessful every single time when asking for another increase. I was able to successfully product change my card in July 2020 from the Discover IT(unsecured) to the Discover IT Cash Back though.

Since May 2020, I've asked for an increase every 30 days(advice from several forums AND their own customer service reps) and I've gotten the same response, **declined**, and same reason in the letter in the mail 7-10 days later: **""INSUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE WITH CURRENT DISCOVER CARD CREDIT LIMIT""**. I even asked yesterday(8/21/2020) and got this same response while on the phone with the customer service rep. She then transferred me to the actual department that handles these requests to try to give me some more advice and/or a better reason why my requests keep getting declined. After having the next guy look over my account, he even confirmed that I:

1. Always pay my bill in full and keep a low utilization ratio
2. Never missed a payment, sometimes even paying multiple times every month(because the limit is so low)
3. Am using the hell out of the cashback rewards on the card
4. From his point of view, I definitely deserved a bigger limit but there's nothing he can do

But he couldn't even tell me why my requests keep getting declined. His advice was to *just keep trying every 30 days*\- aka the same bs I've been hearing the past 4 months. I just can't figure out how much more *experience* they want me to have after having the same $1,000 for 8 months and being a customer for almost 2 years now???

**So I'm asking for some advice here from you all...** Has anyone else experienced anything similar with Discover? Are they usually this stingy with CLIs or could COVID-19 be a factor here? Is there anything else I could be doing differently?

,CreditCards,"tl;dr The title. I really want to hear other CSR/AR users comment on this so ignore literally everything below this if it's too much to read, as it's just me explaining my situation if someone wanted an idea.

Was unsure what flair to put on this, but since I don't plan to get these cards anytime soon, I figured *Discussion* was better than *Help.*

I got 4 cards:

* Discover - June/July 2016 - $7,000 balance

* Uber - April 2019 - $2,400 balance (Cancelling this soon, I'm committed)

* Chase Amazon Prime Rewards - January 2020 - $6,500 balance

* Chase Freedom Unlimited - August 2020 - $10,500 balance

Currently 3/24, though it's looking like I'll be 2/24 by the time travel is normal again. My plan initially was, best case scenario next April/July/TBD/normalness I would acquire the CSP first year then upgrade/downgrade to the CSR/CF depending on how my spending seems to go from there.

This is my first year as a fully independent graduate so I'm still trying to get used to how my spending will be normally. Typically speaking, I travel internationally once a year though last year I did travel internationally twice. First trip ~$5,000 and second trip ~$3,000.

At home annually, I'm on track to spend maybe around ~$3,000 on groceries (though like 2/3rd of that will be at Costco, so Wholesale stores), like ~$840 on gas (when things are normal again, I work from home so I've spent like $43 on gas since March), and maybe at most $720 on dining/takeout (including DoorDash and such) when things are normal and I'm out and about. I'm not even including Lyft here since I'm not going out and about in my state for drinks and such so I can't make a good estimate, but I do use Lyft/Uber occasionally. 

Due to desiring to travel at least once a year, the travel credit from the CSR would always be useful so as far as I'm concerned it's $250 per year. The CSR also seems to have travel insurance what I usually pay $100 a trip for (I know it can be cheaper, I just go with Allianz because I heard good things compared to others), so I could effectively see that as $150 a year if I travel once a year?

I know mostly about how the points system works with the Chase Trifecta, where with the CSR your CFU points are like 2.25x, your CF is worth 7.5x and I *think* your CSR 3x points are worth 4.5x through the travel portal? Pretty neat, and I get why the trifecta is valuable (and I know you can't transfer points among your USB cards or to partners)

Now of course, the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve. A card I hadn't considered since I figured it was too hard to acquire but it does seem in some way feasible due to /u/slash8915's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/idc2nv/i_found_an_easy_way_to_open_a_us_bank_checking/). I live where there are no U.S. Bank branches (though I do plan to move one day to a specific state which does happen to have them), though I am concerned about wondering what's stopping them from catching on and just cancelling the card altogether. I heard getting the Cash+ for a while can also work, and it does seem to be a pretty damn nice card without needing to have a checking account with them. But I digress.

The real reason the USB AR draws me in is (just like everyone else it seems) because of the 3x mobile wallet. I use Apple Pay for anything and everything if I can use it and the only two places I frequent that don't allow it are at a small Asian market I pick up a few things from and Costco Gas (though if I'm not near Costco I do go to Exxon which always has Apple Pay). Other than that, everything else is Apple Pay.

$400 annual fee that's effectively $75 annually thanks to the travel credit, comes with 12 free complimentary WiFi passes (not sure if United works with it, but I can't stand not having WiFi so I always buy it), also has Global Entry credit like CSR, real time rewards, and other things I'm missing. It seems like their travel insurance equivalent is much more limited though.

So I'm pretty much wondering whether to go full Chase Trifecta in the future or start establishing a relationship with U.S. Bank via Cash+ &gt; Altitude Reserve or the way /u/slash8915 mentioned. My main concern is that a few months ago, [U.S. Bank was apparently considering nerfing the 3x mobile wallet in favor of 2x](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/u-s-bank-sends-out-survey-regarding-changes-to-altitude-reserve/). From what I read in the past when the card first came out, someone seemed to mention that USB had a tendency to nerf their cards and were only counting down the days until they removed Mobile Wallet. However that was 3 years ago, but that article from a few months ago about nerfing the Mobile Wallet was somewhat worrying. I already got hurt by the Uber Card, and don't want to get Uber Carded by USB assuming I do go through the effort to establish something with them.

Of course, Chase is well able to do something similar for better or worse as they've shown in the past year, so I know they're not immune here either.

I've seen comparisons in the past between these two cards, but not as much regarding the updated $550 AF CSR. So referring back to the title, CSR users what stops you from going with the AR? Even more so if you do use Apple/Google/Samsung Pay often? 

Thanks in advance!",t2_er74b,False,,0,False,"Sapphire Reserve users, what stops you from going with the Altitude Reserve (requirements aside)?

Hello

I was approved today for the Amex Gold 75k SUB for spending $4,000 over 6 months. 

I had my credit frozen with all three bureaus. On Monday August 17, 2020 I unfroze all my credit reports. 

I checked the pre-qualification site on Amex each day since then and kept getting either the 60k offer or the 35k with cash back offer. 

I checked on CardMatch and the only offer was 75k SUB  for spending $4,000 over 3 months. I would not have been able to spend $4,000 over 3 months, but I can easily complete over 6 months. 

Today I went to the Amex pre-qualification site and got the 75k/6 month offer. 

I applied and was instantly approved. 

This is my first lifetime Amex card.

   * I don't travel for work so all travel perks are for leisure travel
* I'm looking at Amex gold cards and BBP cards but there would still be a significant amount of spend available after getting those
   * No current Amex relationship (previously had Amex Costco card before Citi conversion)
   * We would ultimately keep 1 gold card and 1 BBP
   * I have not been targeted for the 100k or 125k plat

,CreditCards,"I was looking at AMEX's site and saw a couple new SUBs that I hadn't heard of before. I'm not in the market for either of these cards, but they're interesting, even if they aren't far and away the best for either of them. I got both of the unique components in a few private windows, so both seem possible to get by cycling private windows.

[**Amex Gold:**](https://i.imgur.com/WvN7oNU.png) Smaller portion of MR points, plus a 10% back on all spend up to a limit via statement credits. Both seem to have a six month time frame. The one I saw first was 35,000 MR points on $4,000 spend plus 10% back up to $250. This comes out to $600 back, but part of it is not given as MR points so you lose the relative value boost of MR points. Therefore I don't see the benefit over the popular 60,000 MR point SUB. The smaller portion of course requires less spend to get, but if you can't hit the full SUB I don't know why you'd get a Gold.

[**Amex Cash Magnet:**](https://i.imgur.com/tXhkgFJ.png) 10% back up to a limit at supermarkets only, plus a standard cashback statement credit after a minimum spend. Again, both seem to have a six month time frame. The one I saw first was 10% up to $150 plus $150 back after $1,000 in spend. Looking at the SUBs shown on [rankt](https://rankt.com/cards/amex_cash_magnet/) for this card, this seems like a straight up improvement. The highest SUB there is $250 back, and to oversimplify, it's after a total of $7,500 in spend in the first year. This new SUB requires a minimum (if fully optimized) of $1,500 in spend in six months, which is a lot more attainable for the type of user who would want a Cash Magnet. This seems like a response to Chase's Freedom/Freedom Unlimited grocery cashback SUBs, and does certainly make it superior to the FU if you can hit the spend in six months instead of a year.

I'm pretty new here so I don't know if SUBs this complex have existed before, but these are both very interesting SUBs that may be good for some individuals.

,CreditCards,"I applied for the WF Propel yesterday and was denied. I’m basically focused on just getting a card which has phone insurance and no annual fee, while building my credit foundation of cards I will never *need* to close.

What I have so far: 

- discover student card since February 2019 with limit of $4800 (paid off every month less than 10% until)
- Amex cash magnet since June 2020 with limit of $8900 (paid off every month, hanging onto $2k balance just because 0% APR offer) 

Other info:
- no missed payments 
- only loan history I have is two mentioned cards
- last inquiry was about 21 hours ago
- oldest account 1 year 7 months

Considering my fun with WF yesterday, should I wait it out on applying maybe another six months or is Barclays more reasonable? I don’t want to do another hard pull only to find out they’re just as strict as Wells Fargo.

,CreditCards,"So first off I am trying to get a card with no annual fee, which has phone insurance and is with a somewhat big bank. I’ve narrowed it down to two cards: 
- WF Propel 
- JetBlue Card (insurance included since it’s a world MasterCard)

I applied for the WF propel yesterday and was promptly denied. Asked for a reconsideration and was again promptly denied. 

According to my credit report I’m sitting at 710. 

I’ve got two cards so far: 
- Amex cash magnet with $8,900 limit (had since June 2020) 
- Discover student card with a $4,500 limit(since Feb 2019). 

Other useful info 
- income: 60,000

I pay both of my cards in full every month with the exception of right now with the Amex I’m keeping like 20% on it because 0 APR until 2021. Is it possible this is harming me? I’m just keeping the balance so I can gain interest on the money in a savings account. 

Oldest account: February 2019 
- No missed payments
- Only lending history I have is credit cards

Should I try applying for the Barclays JetBlue Card or will they strike me down as well? Basically I’m not looking to just burn through inquiries, and I’m not finding as much information on how strict Barclays is. With a quick search through here it’s obvious WF is very picky, especially with this card. 

My inquiry with WF was made about 18 hours ago, and I’m wondering if it would make more sense before this inquiry posts  before applying for the other one. Is it possibly already too late too? I already got the discover identity protection message saying an inquiry happened yesterday. I see mixed information on how long it takes for a hard pull to show on your report from the lenders perspective. 


Thanks in advance!",t2_s96rl5t,False,,0,False,Should I just wait?,[],r/CreditCards,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iekp8o,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Card Advice,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598139900.0,text,6,,,text,self.CreditCards,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So first off I am trying to get a card with no annual fee, which has phone insurance and is with a somewhat big bank. I’ve narrowed it down to two cards: 
- WF Propel 
- JetBlue Card (insurance included since it’s a world MasterCard)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied for the WF propel yesterday and was promptly denied. Asked for a reconsideration and was again promptly denied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to my credit report I’m sitting at 710. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got two cards so far: 
- Amex cash magnet with $8,900 limit (had since June 2020) 
- Discover student card with a $4,500 limit(since Feb 2019). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other useful info 
- income: 60,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pay both of my cards in full every month with the exception of right now with the Amex I’m keeping like 20% on it because 0 APR until 2021. Is it possible this is harming me? I’m just keeping the balance so I can gain interest on the money in a savings account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oldest account: February 2019 
- No missed payments
- Only lending history I have is credit cards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I try applying for the Barclays JetBlue Card or will they strike me down as well? Basically I’m not looking to just burn through inquiries, and I’m not finding as much information on how strict Barclays is. With a quick search through here it’s obvious WF is very picky, especially with this card. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My inquiry with WF was made about 18 hours ago, and I’m wondering if it would make more sense before this inquiry posts  before applying for the other one. Is it possibly already too late too? I already got the discover identity protection message saying an inquiry happened yesterday. I see mixed information on how long it takes for a hard pull to show on your report from the lenders perspective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

What I am trying to do is transfer a balance from a card with 0% APR is expiring, because I am doing well in the stock market and want to keep more cash invested, while still keeping my more than sufficient emergency fund in savings, and pay off this balance over time. I applied for Chase Slate because 0% APR with $0 balance transfer fee. You currently have to apply in branch, that card is not available online. I have no idea why I got such a low limit. I started thinking maybe the banker misunderstood what I told her for my income and everything, as due to covid I could not touch the keyboard and was speaking through a mask to tell her my financial information, and didn't get to review everything before it was submitted. I called the number on the card and was told even if there was a mistake, I would have to request a limit increase with an additional hard inquiry. I decided to cut my losses and just apply for something with 3% balance transfer fee, assuming I was essentially guaranteed approval whereas the increase on the Chase card seemed less certain.

I also moved in the last two months. When I applied for the Slate card it was originally declined, so the banker said I would have to use my previous address, which I never officially submitted a change of address or anything and can still get mail there as it is a relative's house. On the Citi application I used my previous address since the banker at Chase recommended I do that if I apply for anything else. 

Any advice or am I just going to have to pay the card off? I have the cash its just not the ideal situation in my mind but I am running out of time.

I’ve been reading a lot about how to trigger a chase auto cli and had a clarifying question. One of the ways I’ve been seeing is to use more than the limit on the card each month and then PIF.

The self-managed one has no fees other than a $50 annual fee which is collected at the beginning of the calendar year. I decided to try and open one with the intent of closing it before the beginning of the year. I applied and got instant approved. During the setup process, it gave me the option to open an online banking account with [usbank.com](https://usbank.com) I created an account, then went back to the gold checking application and applied again while logged in.

&lt;p&gt;I did some more digging and found out that their brokerage accounts are open to anyone. The self-managed one has no fees other than a $50 annual fee which is collected at the beginning of the calendar year. I decided to try and open one with the intent of closing it before the beginning of the year. I applied and got instant approved. During the setup process, it gave me the option to open an online banking account with &lt;a href=""https://usbank.com""&gt;usbank.com&lt;/a&gt; I created an account, then went back to the gold checking application and applied again while logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, it was instantly approved! So now I have the fee-free version of the Gold checking account which will give me the required relationship with US Bank to apply for the Altitude Reserve. I just thought this little loophole might be useful for someone else that&amp;#39;s in my situation.&lt;/p&gt;

# Bust Out

Bust-out fraud, also known as sleeper fraud, is primarily a first-party fraud scheme. It occurs when a consumer applies for and uses credit under his or her own name, or uses a synthetic identity, to make transactions. The fraudster makes on-time payments to maintain a good account standing, with the intent of bouncing a final payment and abandoning the account.

During the process, the fraudster builds up a history of good behavior with timely payments and low utilization. Over time, he or she obtains additional lines of credit and requests higher credit limits. Eventually, the fraudster uses all available credit and stops making payments. Overpayments with bad checks are often made in the final stage of the bust-out, temporarily inflating the credit limit and causing losses greater than the account credit limit. \[[source](https://www.experian.com/assets/decision-analytics/white-papers/bust-out-fraud-white-paper.pdf)\]

# Synthetic

Synthetic *identity* fraud is a technique where a fraudster creates an identity using a mix of personal information from different people or a combination of real and fake personal information. Fraudsters use synthetic identities primarily for application fraud, a form of fraud where a bad actor uses a stolen or synthetic ID to apply for a line of credit or a loan with no intention of paying back the lender. Synthetic identity fraud is difficult to detect because fraudsters often hide behind identities and emulated behavior that makes them look like authentic, real people.

*(This was a bit harder to find since most results were talking about - shocker here - pollen.)*

A pollinator is an individual who adds additional authorized users to their lines of credit as an enabler for those authorized users to subsequently open their own lines of credit in order to commit fraud with that established credit history.

The authorized user process is how most synthetic IDs are created. Adding authorized users to an account is legal and allowable by credit card issuers. It is typically used for legitimate purposes, such as adding a spouse or a child. Fraudsters exploit the authorized user process and actively recruit cardholders with good credit to add unknown people/identities to their card, often for just several days. Using this technique, often referred to as “piggybacking,” the legitimate cardholder receives a fee for adding the authorized user identity to his or her account. A credit card is not issued to the authorized user; it simply sits on the credit account for a period and “inherits” the card owner’s credit history. Once the trade lines have reported to the CRAs, the synthetic identity can be removed from the account as an authorized user, but the credit history is retained. The fraudster will then apply for credit with multiple card issuers. With multiple credit lines successfully obtained, the fraudster will max out all the credit lines by buying gift cards and valuable merchandise such as smartphones and other electronics that can be easily sold. \[[source](https://acquirerrisk.com/synthetic-identities-pollinators-and-money-laundering/)\] \[[source](https://securityintelligence.com/synthetic-identity-theft-three-ways-synthetic-identities-are-created/)\]

&lt;h1&gt;Bust Out&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bust-out fraud, also known as sleeper fraud, is primarily a first-party fraud scheme. It occurs when a consumer applies for and uses credit under his or her own name, or uses a synthetic identity, to make transactions. The fraudster makes on-time payments to maintain a good account standing, with the intent of bouncing a final payment and abandoning the account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the process, the fraudster builds up a history of good behavior with timely payments and low utilization. Over time, he or she obtains additional lines of credit and requests higher credit limits. Eventually, the fraudster uses all available credit and stops making payments. Overpayments with bad checks are often made in the final stage of the bust-out, temporarily inflating the credit limit and causing losses greater than the account credit limit. [&lt;a href=""https://www.experian.com/assets/decision-analytics/white-papers/bust-out-fraud-white-paper.pdf""&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Synthetic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthetic &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; fraud is a technique where a fraudster creates an identity using a mix of personal information from different people or a combination of real and fake personal information. Fraudsters use synthetic identities primarily for application fraud, a form of fraud where a bad actor uses a stolen or synthetic ID to apply for a line of credit or a loan with no intention of paying back the lender. Synthetic identity fraud is difficult to detect because fraudsters often hide behind identities and emulated behavior that makes them look like authentic, real people. Fraudsters will mimic credit growth of a real person before they start to bust out on multiple loans.

,CreditCards,"Hi all,

I got new Green and Plat cards fairly recently (60 days). The Green, I know was tested up to at least 33K limit using the online tool. I got the Plat a couple of weeks ago. To satisfy the SUB, I started buying precious metals that I needed anyway -- only about $8K worth. All the spend until recently was just a few hundred dollars (I had just rebuilt my Amex relationship with an Optima with $1100 limit).

Just today, they stopped both cards (and I think my Optima). I called the 800# on the website, and I was transferred to talk to my assigned guy. Long story short, he asked about income and what the charges were about. The income matches the applications in April (Green) and July (Plat), 2020, but is more than TY2019 taxes. The charges were about diversifying my assets to match my current risk strategy as I was a little cash heavy.

Wtf is it to you, Amex guy?! (Just kidding :)

Here's the catch; roughly 6 months ago I switched back from public to private sector, and got a pay bump of 40%+, which matches my applications, so I did not lie. However, this would \*not\* match last year's taxes, which was less. I told the guy twice and he said he would notate, that I did not mislead them and that I don't want some silly process to close all of my cards (shoot first and ask questions later), and that I have paystubs I can show. He said ""don't worry about it, it's not for that"".

They want form 4506T to send to the IRS. This authorizes the release of the taxes (for TY2019). The IRS is to return a transcript for only TY2019 to an Equifax company, that does the processing for Amex. According to them, this is income verification.

My questions:

1. I have the guy's contact info and he'll be owning the issue until it's done. Should I tell him anything/do anything?
2. Is there anything else to try to slip in there like the more recent pay stubs? They would get filtered out by the guy when he sent it to the IRS, but at least they would have them and couldn't claim they didn't know.
3. Any other advice? (I hear these are routine and shouldn't be sweated too hard). Any automation to avoid that will cancel things and ask questions later?
4. I hear that if you get 2 FRs for the same thing (specific example was to send money to a person of the same billing address via PayPal), you get all cards cancelled and possible blacklist. Is that true? Can I no longer buy metals with these (or risk getting cards canceled).
5. Should I pay it all off ASAP? I could just pay it all off. Would that make any different with the guys in ""back office"" doing the evaluation?
6. Will I have an opportunity to explain anything from the point after they get the tax analysis back from the Equifax company?
7. Who will venture to guess the reason?  The buying of precious metals?  Unusual spend?  New account?  Previous history of missed payments (5 years ago)?  All of the above?  :)

Thanks!",t2_1cxes9rj,False,,0,False,Amex Financial Review for buying metals? Last year's taxes and app income won't match...,[],r/CreditCards,False,6,,0,,False,t3_id21nw,False,dark,0.67,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,1597976311.0,,[],{},,True,,1597919765.0,text,6,,,text,self.CreditCards,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got new Green and Plat cards fairly recently (60 days). The Green, I know was tested up to at least 33K limit using the online tool. I got the Plat a couple of weeks ago. To satisfy the SUB, I started buying precious metals that I needed anyway -- only about $8K worth. All the spend until recently was just a few hundred dollars (I had just rebuilt my Amex relationship with an Optima with $1100 limit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today, they stopped both cards (and I think my Optima). I called the 800# on the website, and I was transferred to talk to my assigned guy. Long story short, he asked about income and what the charges were about. The income matches the applications in April (Green) and July (Plat), 2020, but is more than TY2019 taxes. The charges were about diversifying my assets to match my current risk strategy as I was a little cash heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wtf is it to you, Amex guy?! (Just kidding :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the catch; roughly 6 months ago I switched back from public to private sector, and got a pay bump of 40%+, which matches my applications, so I did not lie. However, this would *not* match last year&amp;#39;s taxes, which was less. I told the guy twice and he said he would notate, that I did not mislead them and that I don&amp;#39;t want some silly process to close all of my cards (shoot first and ask questions later), and that I have paystubs I can show. He said &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t worry about it, it&amp;#39;s not for that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

Stats at the time of the application:

* 1 card: TD Cash, 368 days old, CL $650. 0% utilization (due date is ~3 days before statement date...).

* Experian: FICO 8: 750. 3 hard inquiries, all at least 12 months old. No derogatory marks.

I had opened a Chase checking account on 2020-06-15. I have a few thousand in there now and have been using it as my normal account, probably at least 20 actions since creation. I did not have any prequal offers in there; probably due in no small part to the account being very new.

I applied on 2020-08-17. They pulled Experian, but I'm not sure if they also pulled TU or EQ. Got the ""We have received your request for a Chase credit card. We'll let you know our decision as soon as possible"" on the webpage and an email. Called the status line and got the 30 day message. Called the recon line, asked if they needed any information from me. They did the text message verification code, then said there was nothing more to say at this time. Called the status line twice the next day, 30 day message both times.

Today, 2020-08-19, I got a call from Chase around 1 PM.

,CreditCards,"Hello, 

So I had this debt that I was unaware of. I did not return a text book from college, I was charged about $350, which was eventually bought by some debt collector company. I checked my credit score about a year ago and found out about this debt and paid it off right then. So I had a credit score of about 500, which is not great. So that explained why I was always denied when applying for a credit score. 

So here is where I need advice, how do I know get approved for a credit score? I waited about 5 months after paying off the debt, but when I applied I was denied again because of no credit history. How do I build a credit history? Is there a way to get a credit card through my parents? and If I can do that, would that technically build my credit?

,CreditCards,"Little bit of background. I'm a Risk Analyst at one of the top 10 US credit card companies, with about 7 years of experience. I close down credit cards that have the risk of being Bust Out, Synthetic, Pollinator and Scam. We usually do so without telling you before hand and you get a letter/email/phone call after it has happened. I'm going to post some examples of what NOT to do with your credit cards.

Okay, so this one is more about what we did NOT see. Also this example might be a ""No duh!"" type example, but it's more for people that are new to credit, have damaged credit, or no credit.

This account was open very recently and we closed it less than a week after it was open.

Single Credit Card: Open in July 2020.

We closed it for,

1. Lack of credit information
2. Credit not deep enough

To be honest these are our bullshit closures. When nothing else fits, we use these two. Also they pretty much mean the same thing, the wording is a little bit different.

Now, I hate these type of accounts, I hate closing them and I hate telling the customer why they are closed, because at times I feel like a idiot. This account should have never been open in the first place, yet due to someone in the Lending or Verification department not taking the time to review the credit card application in detail, it gets passed to us to close it less than a week after it was open. We are basically the hatchet men for these types of accounts and it's one of the few things about this job that I absolutely despise.

Now lets get to the reason why we closed it.

Year of birth: 1981

Experian: Empty

TransUnion: Empty

Equifax: Something

Right away we have a red flag. Two of the three bureau's not reporting anything? Not a single inquiry, account, collections, not even the months on file?

This is what we have on the Equifax.

On-file date: 2013

10 inquiries in the past 24 months, all spread out, all for telephone companies

One collection for a telephone company, that was pretty recent.

A utility trade line from 2012, that was also in collections.

And that's it.

Just from this, this person should never have gotten a credit card. As far as we can tell, they never had any sort of credit in their life, even though they were eligible for credit around the year 2000. Social Security Card was also issued in the 80's.

And that's it! A very simple closure, for a credit card that should have never gone past the application phase.

My advice for anyone in a similar situation? Get yourself a secured credit card.

Random google search: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/secured](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/secured)

It's a type of credit card for people with limited or damaged credit that requires the user to place a refundable security deposit ($500), which the car's issuer holds as collateral until the account is closed.

It's not going to be as nice as a fancy Chase, Discover or American Express card, but it's the best way to start building/rebuilding your credit.

,CreditCards,"New to reddit and churning, I'm looking into starting my journey with Amex because Chase is being difficult with approvals especially now due to the Rona. I have a few questions: 

**Credit score:** 751 

**Number of cards:** 1 BOA cash back card (currently 0/24 b/c that card opened 4 years ago)

**Number of cards applied for within past year:** 2 (Chase Freedom and Amex BCE) and denied for both in January (didn't realize I had an account payable and was an authorized user on cards hurting my utilization, I have since taken care of both) 

1) Is all hope lost for Chase and is it worth it to try for the Chase Freedom or go with Amex because I'm being targeted for the gold card 75k point offer. Also note, I have a recent student loan account that's 11 months old, which I heard with Chase you should wait 13 months after opening new accounts.

2) Are SUBs available for each card when you sign up? For example, if I start with the Everyday Card, will I still receive the SUB for the Gold card after waiting 6 months when I sign up (not upgrade). I understand that it varies based on if you've closed/opened but that doesn't apply to me since I'm new and I'm confused by the 'Once in a Lifetime' phrasing

3)  Does the same apply for SUBs for Amex Business? I have an online retailing business and would like to start with BBP now and file for a Business Gold in a few months when I know I'll be spending more on ads

I have a few questions: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit score:&lt;/strong&gt; 751 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of cards:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 BOA cash back card (currently 0/24 b/c that card opened 4 years ago)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of cards applied for within past year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 (Chase Freedom and Amex BCE) and denied for both in January (didn&amp;#39;t realize I had an account payable and was an authorized user on cards hurting my utilization, I have since taken care of both) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Is all hope lost for Chase and is it worth it to try for the Chase Freedom or go with Amex because I&amp;#39;m being targeted for the gold card 75k point offer. Also note, I have a recent student loan account that&amp;#39;s 11 months old, which I heard with Chase you should wait 13 months after opening new accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

I assumed this would be easy because that&amp;#39;s practically just my bills. Problem is I pay my bills to family members, like my parents for rent and my brother for internet, and I use Venmo to do so. I saw Venmo allows you to pay with credit card but it will cost an additional 3%. Is there a way around this so that I can use my credit card to earn the points but not be charged the 3% fee? Perhaps using another payment method? I was thinking transferring credit from the card to my checking account, but that will cause a transfer fee right? or is that treated as a cash advance?

I recently applied for the Wells Fargo Propel Card, aiming for those nice category cash backs, and was promptly denied. Their reasoning was (and I'm paraphrasing, as I can't recall the exact wordage) 1)poor payment history 2)high balances 3)recent credit activity.

,CreditCards,"So my PayPal Cashback card’s due date was on Aug 2, and on that day I paid the entire current balance, in the app, of about $160. Immediately after, I realized that I actually needed the payment to come from a different bank account, so I tapped on the option to modify the payment, selected the correct bank, and got an email confirmation about it going through. A few days later, I noticed that the payment still hadn’t pulled from my bank, and the PayPal app was still showing my due date as Aug 2, with the same balance.

I called customer service and confirmed that my payment was showing, but some glitch was preventing it from actually posting properly right now. Also confirmed that the payment was definitely on time, for the whole balance, and that it wouldn’t reflect as a missed payment or have any interest charged. Was told I didn’t need to do anything on my end.

Several more days go by, and still the payment hasn’t pulled from my bank. However now I have new post-statement activity in the app, showing first that some interest actually was charged, but then a credit of that exact amount was applied afterwards (I guess this was their solution?), and also it does show that correct payment amount being applied.

As of today, this is still where I stand. I double-checked and my current balance on the card does seem to reflect that payment going through. I also triple-checked both bank accounts in question, and 100% confirmed that no payment was ever actually pulled from either of them. Is it really possible that I got a free $160 out of PayPal’s glitch, and/or CSR incompetence? My main concern is that the payment is suddenly going to be pulled out of nowhere, potentially overdrawing my account. I’ve been keeping at least that amount in there just in case, but I’d rather not have to worry about it.

However now I have new post-statement activity in the app, showing first that some interest actually was charged, but then a credit of that exact amount was applied afterwards (I guess this was their solution?), and also it does show that correct payment amount being applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, this is still where I stand. I double-checked and my current balance on the card does seem to reflect that payment going through. I also triple-checked both bank accounts in question, and 100% confirmed that no payment was ever actually pulled from either of them. Is it really possible that I got a free $160 out of PayPal’s glitch, and/or CSR incompetence? My main concern is that the payment is suddenly going to be pulled out of nowhere, potentially overdrawing my account. I’ve been keeping at least that amount in there just in case, but I’d rather not have to worry about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make this all as clear as possible. Please let me know if any clarification is needed, and thanks in advance for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

I am a brand new credit card holder. I recently got a secured credit card of $500.I want to keep my utilization 10% or lower.

My statements was posted on 8/13 and my Payment Due Date is 9/10. My balance is $38

When should I make the payment? Is it okay to make the payment NOW? Or should I wait closer to my payment date?

Some people talk about statement date vs payment date and thats where I get confused. I would like a little more clarity.

If any of you have some insight I will greatly appreciate it!

I heard all the buzz about the Amex Gold's 60K offer so I decided to check out the prequalify tool and to my surprise, I got a 75K offer!

I've been a loyal Chase user so this would be my first Amex card. I had no intentions of getting a new card, but this offer seems too good to be true. What would you do in my situation?

* CSR / CIC / CIP
* Chase Amazon Prime

I'm 1/24 right now and recently got the CIP about 7 months ago. FICO score above 760. 4 hard inquiries and the next one won't expire til mid next year.

My next move was going to be the CFU for effectively 7.5% groceries and then the CIC (when Chase is less stringent about sole proprietors). The Amex Gold would suit my grocery needs, but I'm really just after that sign-up bonus. Unless they give me a good retention offer, I'm not sure I want to continue to hold onto the card when I'm already vested in the Chase ecosystem. What would be my downgrade options for the Gold?

8/11 it was scheduled for delivery. it said i need a signature, so i intentionally didn’t sign because i wasn’t home that day and didn’t want it left out. for some reason it delivered. 1st floor of an apartment complex

i call best buy when i get home 8 hours later because there’s no package outside. they start an investigation. the reps are clueless. the first guy i talked to said hes issuing me a refund right then and there (totally wrong, they have to do an investigation first)

anyhow, after many many calls to best buy, i got an email on 8/16 saying they won’t refund or replace the item. talk to ups or law enforcement. 

well, i talked to ups 8/14, 3 days after calling best buy. UPS said the imac tracking number has no investigation open and only the shipper can file a claim. i called today, 8/17, and they still said no claim was open on this tracking number. they also said no signature confirmation was requested for this package which best buy confirmed (but when i signed into ups mychoice it said sig required?? it says that for all my packages idk why) 
they said they’re not asking for signature require due to COVID. thats absolutely bs to not let your customers know that because i would have done in store pickup if that was the case. 

law enforcement isn’t an option bc i dont know what happened to the package. so i filed a dispute with my bank (visa wells fargo) for a chargeback. what are my chances? 

i’m freaking out bc i cannot afford a $2200 loss. like not figuratively i cannot afford it, like literally i won’t be able to pay rent or i won’t be able to buy a computer which is absolutely vital to me right now. 

i dont feel like this was my fault. i know no one can help if it was stolen, but how the hell do you ship a $2200 computer without signature confirmation????? 

what are my chances of winning this chargeback y’all please anyone who’s had similar cases help

*edit* so i checked my email and THANKFULLY, i have a UPS my choice email saying a signature is REQUIRED for this package. no signature was given, thus the delivery was not completed, correct? i’m not an asshole, i just knew ups policy is to redeliver when a signature cannot be acquired, i never once thought that they would leave it there without one

*edit 2* so i’m an idiot. my neighbor brought in the package because he “didn’t want someone to steal it”. he’s a sweet old man and he’s a bit senile. he said it slipped his mind to let me know he brought it in and apologized profusely. i just thanked him for doing that, didn’t feel the need to let him know how much of a headache it caused me. the package was like 30 pounds so the fact that this cute old man who walks with a cane dragged it into his place is so so nice of him. 
i canceled the dispute with my bank and told best buy i found the package and i returned it to best buy bc honestly fuck them and their shitty ass response to my missing package and not having a signature required for a $2200 package. never buying from this piece of shit company again. 
although for those who are reading this who are in a similar situation, wells fargo told me on 4 different occasions we basically would win the case. a no signature ups “proof of delivery” does not suffice as actual proof of delivery. so again, fuck you best buy. learn how to run a corporation you pieces of shit. and no, i’m not salty bc my neighbor took it, i’m salty bc best buy conducted an “investigation” without ever reaching out to ups. they didn’t even do the bare minimum and were okay with letting me take a $2200 loss. but all is well now",t2_j456p,False,,0,False,Chargeback for missing iMac?? advice please 🥺,[],r/CreditCards,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ibjrjw,False,dark,0.87,,public,11,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,11,,False,,1598030621.0,,[],{},,True,,1597717566.0,text,6,,,text,self.CreditCards,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hey guys&lt;/p&gt;

,CreditCards,"I was recently denied on an application for a Citibank premium travel co-branded card (Citi Expedia). I was told I had insufficient positive credit history.

So, let’s say I buy food for $30, it clears, I pay it off days later. Do this a few times a month and when the billing period ends my balance is $0.

Is it okay for me to pay off a balance right after it clears? Or should I want until it’s near 30% utilization before I pay it off in full? And keeping my balance $0 before the cycle ends?

Should I (and is it still possible to) downgrade my CSR given there isn&amp;#39;t much use for a Freedom? Or should I just apply for a Freedom and downgrade next year?

Anyway, I've been using the card over the past year and a half and have been making use of the rotating 5% CB categories when possible. I've never missed a payment and I recently financed a used car where I saw my FICO score was about 750 between the 3 credit agencies.

We use “Commute with Enterprise” at work. It’s a carpool program that (in our case) is reimbursed in full every month. 1 hour drive to work, 1 hour back. 


Here’s a quick breakdown. Each van has 6-7 riders and a coordinator who pays for the van and fuel every month, $985 for the van, about $200-300 for fuel. Some coordinators deal in cash and prepaid gas cards but that doesn’t leave for much accountability imo. Add in lost cards and rollover balance it it gets hairy. Most coordinators, myself included, use a credit/debit card to pay the van in full at the beginning of the month and the same card is used to fuel the van every few days. I collect all receipts and payment info at the end of each month, scan them to .pdf, add up the total and divide by 7 (total riders in the van so we all pay the same), email each rider the info, then we each individually do the online voucher. Once I send out the email, my riders send me that amount to my personal account. 


A few years ago, I started using my Chase Freedom card because for 3 months out of the year, it would have 5% cash back on fuel. Awhile later I got a BoA Travel Rewards card that offered the same 5% on fuel but different months. Example, Jan-March I’d use the chase card for 5% back, then April-June I’d swap out the card for the BoA to get that 5% back. The other half of the year it would only be 1%. I was fine with that but the BoA 5% cash back seems to have vanished so I’m down to 5% back on fuel for only 3 months out of the year. 


How can I maximize potential points/cash back/miles? My score is 812 (820 last month) experian, 845 TU, not sure on the third. 0 late payments and I pay off all balances in full. I’m thinking about canceling the BoA card (side question, if paid off and no bad marks or balance, does it hurt anything to cancel a credit card after a few years?) and replacing it with something better suited to this scenario. I’ve had the chase card a lot longer and it still does the 5%, should I upgrade to sapphire or something? I’m fine with whatever rewards I can get, my wife and I do travel overseas every couple years but whatever has the best bang for the buck. 


**TD;DR:** I spend around $1,200 or so a month, every month, on vehicle rental and gas. What credit card can I use to take advantage of this to maximize points/cash back/miles?

,CreditCards,"So to try to make a long story short, I'm planning to buy a new laptop for around $1700 with taxes and was going to put about half down and half on credit.

I didn't mind as I've actually never had one (other than PayPal credit) and all of my credit reports suggest I could benefit from using one some.

So I went through a list looking at possible options and wanted to go for the Amex Everyday Card, but their website said I didn't pre-qualify even though my fico score hovers around 750. So because of this, I went through with another card - the US Bank Platinum Visa that has the initial 20 months of 0% APR - which still doesn't seem to be too bad.

My husband is in the army and we were transferred right in the beginning of March when COVID started from Georgia to Hawaii. 

I had a job lined up 3 months before arrival but because of Covid it fell through as child care centers here are not taking on any new clients due to Covid so we have no one to care for our one year old. 



That being said, things are tight but we still have the finances to make all payments which we have been doing. The only change has been we finally switched our bank account to Navy Fed (if any of my military readers are familiar with this bank).


From years before I met my husband when my finances were not capable of covering my everyday needs (groceries, gas etc) I have two card with a bank called Credit One. 

Well now apparently I have ONE. 
They have CLOSED one of my cards. I missed ONE payment not because we didn’t have the money but because when I logged in to pay it was refusing to process and the payment was due on a Friday and we are 6 hours behind the mainland here so by the time I called customer service they were closed.

Regardless of that attempt, this crappy banks customer service options are extremely limited to the point that I was actually calling customer service without my issue actually being an option to speak to an operator. They really try to screw you by making all serious issues ONLY CONTACTABLE BY MAIL.

,CreditCards,"Hello! My (24F) first post here, looking for some advice. I've had my CSP since Nov 2018 and got the 65k SUB Feb 2019. I initially got it for the SUB and no FTF for my international trip last year. Since then I have mainly been using it for dining, but recently I hardly spend on that. I am thinking to downgrade it since the $95 AF probably doesnt make sense right now for my low spend and I won't be planning any travel anytime soon due to covid. I'm on the fence because if I'm able to travel next year (covid willing), I wouldn't be able to transfer points to travel partners or even have the added redemption bonus through the UR Travel portal. I have 95k UR pts right now.

Does it make more sense to downgrade CSP or suck up the AF for now in hopes I can redeem my UR points at higher value for travel next year? The AF will hit again this December. If I downgrade, I'm thinking of getting CS to keep the 2x dining with no AF because I don't have a card with dining rewards. If I go this route I would later downgrade CS to CF 6 months before I'm eligible to apply for another Sapphire SUB (not eligible until 2023). I always see comments saying downgrading to CS never seems worth it. I don't think I'd ever get close to maxing the $1500 quarterly max spend on CF's 5% categories so I don't think I necessarily need a 2nd CF. Or should I downgrade to a 2nd CF anyway, and if I really wanted dining rewards, maybe apply for US Bank Altitude Go for 4x on dining (or any other no AF CC with dining rewards). Added note, I just opened the CF this month for the SUB, so I think I should wait a few months before I try to apply for another card (especially if applying for US bank b/c I have no existing relationship).

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;• Fico 8 score: 695 EX, 697 EQ, 729 TU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;• Cards: Capital One Venture (2009, CL $3300), Discover It (AU, 6/17/2020, CL $1500), CF (7/23/2020, CL $1000). I also went through a credit card consolidation program from 2015 to March of 2020 and closed 6 other credit cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;• Oldest account age: 11 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;• 5 Late Payments: 1 in 2015, 2 in 2016, 1 in 2018, and 1 in January 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;• Income: 60k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;• 3 inquires in the last 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone with a similar situation and on a brink of applying for this card. I think this is a good time to apply for this card before this offer runs out. Also, I think this is the first time since this Pandemic that credit card companies are starting to accept more applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, first post! I applied to the Chase Freedom card today to try building a relationship with Chase, but after I submitted the online application I got immediately rejected on the same website. 

I know my income is extremely low, which is probably why I got rejected, but I had a couple of questions: 1) Should I have put tuition scholarship money as untaxable income? I declared $0 untaxable income, but I am attending college on a tuition scholarship worth $40k and have no student debt. 2) If I got instant rejected like this on their website, will I still get a hard pull? And is it even worth trying to call their reconsideration line?

,CreditCards,"Hi guys,

I am confused about when to pay my credit card bill to optimize my score.

My due date is always on the 16th, but my statement date is different every month, usually somewhere between the 19-21st.  I’ve noticed that what affects the credit score is whatever the balance is on the statement date.  This month, my statement is on the 21st.

I always pay my credit card in full every month.  Last month, I paid in full on the due date of the 16th, however, by the time the statement date rolled around (I think on the 21st), I had already spent $500 more, and it made my credit score go down because the utilization was too high! Shouldn’t I be rewarded with an addition of points if I paid on my due date?

My question is: when do I pay to optimize my score and have my utilization close to 0% on the statement date? This month, I plan on skipping the due date and waiting till the 20th to pay everything off, so by the 21st, the utilization will be close to 0%, making my score go up.  But in afraid if I skip the due date of the 16th, I will get punished for it.  I also don’t want to have to pay more than once a month because that is tedious and annoying.

What should I do?

&lt;p&gt;My question is: when do I pay to optimize my score and have my utilization close to 0% on the statement date? This month, I plan on skipping the due date and waiting till the 20th to pay everything off, so by the 21st, the utilization will be close to 0%, making my score go up.  But in afraid if I skip the due date of the 16th, I will get punished for it.  I also don’t want to have to pay more than once a month because that is tedious and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, I've decided to cool down on the amount of cards I have and will probably not apply for any cards for a few years. However, I was just curious and wanted to know what cards I should be eyeing at next? I can't get any Chase cards because in 2017, Chase mysteriously banned me for no reason while I had a High School checking account and told me that the ban is permanent. I really wanted the Chase Sapphire Reserve in the future, but looks that that will never happen. Sigh.

,CreditCards," 

I got my first credit card with BoA in January. Its credit limit is $500. I started my first job after school in March; I work with a well-known tech company as a software engineer ($100k+/year).

My FICO score came out last month, it's 710. I want a credit limit increase now and hope to apply for Chase unlimited in 2021. How much increase should I ask for. Would $800/$900/$1000 be too much or low?

I did requested a credit limit increase 3-ish months ago, but BoA denied it because I hadn't had the card long enough. Would it be fine for me to ask for it now? Also, my paycheck goes directly to my BoA checking account, if that helps.

,CreditCards,"So after a few weeks of planning this, I finally decided to take a personal loan from Payoff. For those not familiar, this is basically a loan given for the purpose of wiping out all cc debt, and then paying back that loan rather than the individual cc's. Rates are lower on the loan, and you make off all the wiser

So this is what I did. Wiped off about 15k cc debt, and now have a 15k personal loan, that I pay monthly. 

After paying the first month, my credit score.shot up 100 points. The report shows me having accrued no larger ""personal loan"" balance, while my current ""credit card"" balances have dropped, as I paid them all off last month. 

Am I just awaiting for the transaction to clear and for the personal loan $$ increase, or is my credit score really 100 points hire for just swapping debt types -- cc for personal loan?",t2_7f8bfv9l,False,,0,False,Took a debt consolidation loan from Payoff - how will my credit score be impacted?,[],r/CreditCards,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iam3ub,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1597580305.0,text,6,,,text,self.CreditCards,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after a few weeks of planning this, I finally decided to take a personal loan from Payoff.

,CreditCards,"I NEED to rent a car. I do not have a credit card. I live in West Columbia, SC. I have a prepaid booking through Priceline and I have not been assigned a specific rental car company that I will be picking up the car from. I know from past experience that my local airport for some reason is extremely strict about who can use a debit card for a deposit or to even rent a car paying in full. 
      I would consider my self a seasoned veteran when it comes to knowing my way around credit cards, debit cards, and the United States financial system in general. Due solely to my lack of making good choices I ran up lots of credit card debt, and now I am out of having a credit card at all. 
      My question is can any of the US rental car corporations (Focusing on the big 3 Conglomerates/Corporate Giants: Hertz/Dollar/Thrifty, Enterprise/National/Alamo, &amp; last but not least Avis/Budget/Zipcar), tell the actual difference or distinguish whether the payment method that’s being used for a deposit whether or not an actual Credit card vs. a Debit Card? Has anyone ever gotten away with presenting a debit card when they clearly requested a credit card and no issues arise from doing so? The card will have enough to cover the deposit and none of the 4 debit cards I have to choose from are prepaid cards. (SoFi MasterCard with no debit card labels on it, MoneyLion Visa, Roarmoney VISA, and lastly a GreenDot BANK account not prepaid card that could pass for being a Secured GreenDot Credit Card with the debit card marking covered as well. 
     From what I understand every time I would rent a vehicle in the past. They would immediately ask me if I was using a debit card or a credit card. Even with proof of round trip travel, and providing not only all of the requested documents listed on their websites; along with being above the minimum required renters age. They act as if the employee working the rental car counter is doing absolutely everything in their power to do all but rent me a car. 
     I understand that I am fairly young, 23 years of age. They completely ignore the policy listed on the website. They ignore the sign right in front of my face sitting in clear view on top of the counter facing me, but away from the employee. They give me excuses such as “The debit card &amp; proof of round trip travel accommodation only applies to renters with an out of state drivers license”, “You must be at least 30 years old to use a debit card to rent a vehicle, unless you’re a government or military employee”. Even after attempting to have a family friend of mine currency in the US Air Force reserves. She immediately changes the policy to current DOD (Department of Defense), or US Military service members on as she seemed to explain current official business acting on behalf of the United States military interests. 
     At this point I believe she became suspicious, and was thinking that he was attempting to rent the car solely for the point of letting me drive it. I do not understand that after many attempts which as of this moment have failed. I have applied for a secured credit card through Self (formerly Self lender) a credit builder account/loan. And it will be another 60 days before I am actually going to even receive the card. 
     It is currently 6:30 AM (EST) as I’m posting this seeking ol’ reliable’s (Reddit) advice. I made a prepaid booking using my parents credit card and I know I can get the reservation canceled, along with a refund even though last minute low rate prepaid bookings on Hotwire, or Priceline for rental vehicles are typically non-refundable, &amp; cannot be changed, modified, or cancelled. 
      I have had some luck in the past joining National car rentals Emerald Club which is a service that allows you to go straight to the rental cars and just pick one on the marked emerald club aisles, hop in any car you pick &amp; drive off. 
       However, before you can exit the airport with the vehicle you’re required to stop at the gate maintained by an employee who does once last confirmation and since you’re skipping the counter someone has to verify your drivers license. I am aware that you can add &amp; manage payment methods online, so I could in theory use my parents credit card and rental car companies actually have no way of verifying what name is connected to the card you link. I have had success with this once back in 2016 when the new Mustangs were just going on sale. 
       I checked the most recent &amp; updated Terms and conditions of the emerald club and no longer does it say like in the past that newly updated credit cards and brand new emerald club members must present the card to the booth employee when leaving. I had a buddy who did the same thing once and he gave them a prepaid monkey Visa card and the employee did not even swipe the card, and if he did for some reason they allowed him to leave with no issues, and even after he turned in his vehicle they still ended up charging the credit card he did not have present with him. 
      I apologize for the long post/question. New to reddit (TL;DR?): I need to rent a car from the same state my license is issued from. Do not have credit card nor anybody who can rent the vehicle for me. However, I do have 4 different debit cards linked to a SoFi checking account, MoneyLion both Roar Checking, and regular moneylion checking, separate visa debit cards issued from both accounts, and last but not least the card that gave me this idea a GreenDot Bank visa debit card. 
       This card does not say debit card on it so I truly believe that as long as they just swipe my card and I tell them it’s just a GreenDot secured credit card, or my SoFi MasterCard also has a much more modern design and my activation sticker does a good job of inconspicuously covering up the debit card marking on the SoFi card.

I have been on this subreddit for a few days and everything I have read has been super helpful. I just want to ask a few questions that I am hoping some of you can answer.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is applying for multiple credit cards really that ideal? I see a bunch of people on here strategizing how to acquire a bunch of the Chase ones. I even notice that a guy has CFU and is still applying for Chase Freedom. Should I do this as well?
2. Do student loans have a huge affect on whether or not one is approved for a credit card?
3. Today I went from 35% utilization to 8%. Should I expect a huge jump in my credit score?
4. Is it possible to get the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card as your first credit card?

**# of Credit Cards:** 0 (I am an authorized user on my mother's); (2 years and three months credit age)

**Current Credit Score:** Credit Karma (749); Experian (666)? I just paid my debt off though

,CreditCards,"I recently applied and got approved for the Citi Double Cash card. So far my initial impressions with Citi have not been great

# Initial card activation woes

There software suite app and online web application seem subpar/buggy when compared to other card providers. For example, when approved for the card you setup a username and password. When you receive the card it tells you, you can activate the card via mobile app. The problem is when you try and login in for the first time on the app to activate the card it tells you, you are unable to logging until you create your security questions, which you must do online. There are other disconnects like this as well when trying to setup the rest of the account in the app, for example you can only enter a phone number in the browser, meaning you have to break workflow in the app to go to certain things that can only be done online. And their site tries to use flash...ickkkk  


# Second time using the card: account locked and verification unable to be completed on the phone with customer service

I used the card for the first time at a brick and mortar store with no problems. A couple of days later I was making my first online purchase on Amazon. About 15 minutes after making the purchase since it was my first time using the card I opened the app to just make sure everything went through correctly. Upon doing that I saw I had an alert ""To protect these accounts we need you to call us right away. Your ability to use there accounts may be limited until we hear for you"". I click past the app and don't see the Amazon charge. Okay this is weird I received no active notification from Citi in anyway, no email, no phone call, no push notification of a problem.

I called them and they tell me they need to do a couple of things to verify my identity. They ask from my secret word, I give it to them. They ask for my phone number I have on file so they can send me a text message to verify my identity. The lady informs me they are unable to use that phone number to verify me and ask if I have another number to provide. (I'm lost at how a new arbitrary number can be used for verification). This all fails. The lady is unable to verify me and unable to tell me why. I obviously can't find out why the card got locked because they can't identify. She informs me the only other option to verify me is to send me snail mail which can take 5 to 7 business days. So now I'm sitting on a bricked card because who knows why?

I’ve been wanting to apply for the United Explorer card but I’ve waited since I just got the Freedom at the end of this past June. I also want the Gold card at some point, especially since i got the 75k sign up bonus offer for the card (prequalified). Ideally, I want both cards soon but there are several considerations I could use help weighing in on.

I’m pretty sure applying for both cards is going to make the order of applications important. One of my worries is that I don’t know how long the increased Amex Gold offer will last, so grabbing the card now is tempting. However, I know the United increased offer ends 9/30/2020. I worry that if I apply for the Gold first, Chase will have more reason to reject the United application based on too many new accounts (1 opened March 2020 and 1 June 2020). I don’t worry as much about Amex denying on that same condition. What would be the best strategy for me acquiring both of these cards before their sign-up bonuses are changed?

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to apply for the United Explorer card but I’ve waited since I just got the Freedom at the end of this past June. I also want the Gold card at some point, especially since i got the 75k sign up bonus offer for the card (prequalified). Ideally, I want both cards soon but there are several considerations I could use help weighing in on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure applying for both cards is going to make the order of applications important.
